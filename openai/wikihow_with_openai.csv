Add a couple of teaspoons of ginger, one teaspoon of menthol ointment (over-the-counter), or several drops of eucalyptus oil. Go to a sink with water warm enough to form steam and fill the sink with hot water. You’ll also need a towel, so have one handy. Drape the towel over the back of your head so the ends drop around either side of your head. Breathe in the steam for a few minutes.; , Taking a warm shower before work can also help to relieve some of your congestion. This is another form of steam remedy. Make sure the bathroom door is closed so the steam from the shower builds.Shower as normal with very warm water.   This is only going to be practical at home.  , If you have a throbbing and congested head compounded by difficulty breathing through the nose then a compress is one way to go. Take a thick set of paper towels or clean linen cloth and soak it in warm water. Wrench or squeeze it out so it doesn’t drip everywhere. Allow it to rest on your forehead. Don’t let the water get so hot it burns you.This can be done at home and work.  , You can try this for a throat remedy. Honey is a good soothing substance for a sore throat and cough. Mix in a teaspoon with some hot tea for a beverage.This can be done at home or work. You may want to prepare the mix at home and put the drink in an insulated thermos to take to work.  , This is one environmental solution. If you want to use this at work you will need to be in a relatively small area or it won’t be too effective. And you will need permission most likely. Clean the machine with a solution of bleach every few days to stop the growth of mold or bacteria.The humidifier moistens the air, which can ease congestion in the head and chest.  , This is one oral method you can try. Mixing in a teaspoon of salt with warm water to gargle with can be a quick way to relieve a sore throat at work.You want to do this in the bathroom of your work place.  , Remove the cap. Insert the nozzle into one of your clogged nasal passages. Squeeze in one or two drops while simultaneously clamping shut the other nostril. Inhale deeply. Release the clamped nostril. Follow the instructions on the label to be more precise.Saline or salt water sprays are simple over-the-counter nasal rinses that can thin mucus, relieve postnasal drip, and moisten dry nasal passages. These sprays also have some benefits for removing viruses and bacteria from the nose. They are not medicated so are usually very safe for adults and even kids.  , Open the cap. Insert the tip into one nostril and squirt in one or two pumps. Do the same for the other nostril. You may need to follow other instructions according to your doctor, pharmacist, and/or the label.These are medicated and relieve swollen or stuffy noses. Generally these are safe for most conditions including the flu, but if you’re using this for more than three days you need to stop and see a doctor. Using for more than three days can result in medication induced rebound congestion. These come in pill form too. However, either the pill or spray decongestants can increase blood pressure and heart rate. Two common forms of the oral variety are pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine—both over-the-counter. If you are going to be working then your blood pressure and heart rate may fluctuate more from the daily stress. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about safety issues.  , There are several types of over-the-counter cough syrups that fight the cough by different means in the case of the flu. You’ll want to have one of these with you while at work if you have a coughing fit. You can try a suppressant or an expectorant (such as guaifenesin) to force up mucus.Cough drops and throat lozenges are a great way to treat a cough and/or sore throat at home and at work. Keep some sugar-free cough drops or throat lozenges on hand all day. Less practical for work and more for home treatment of coughs would be topical treatments like menthol rubs for your chest.  , Nasal strips can help to open your nasal passages and make breathing easier. One of these can fit on the lower third of your nose. A plastic strip under a bandage like strip springs out to gently pull open your nose and this eases your breathing. You can easily wear this at work all day., Colds and flus can be painful, so taking an over-the-counter pain reliever may help. Make sure that you follow the dosage instructions on the package. Ingest the pills with plenty of water. Place extra pills in a pill box or keep the bottle in a handy place such as a purse, bag, or desk drawer.Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or other analgesics like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve) are available over-the-counter for pain relief. These medicines also reduce fever. Make sure that you check the ingredients on any cold or flu medicine you are taking. Many of these medicines already contain a pain reliever and it is important to avoid doubling up on these. This can cause severe problems, such as kidney damage.  , If your illness is viral, then taking an antiviral medication may help. Talk to your doctor about getting these medicines prescribed. Have the medicine administered within 48 hours of the onset of your illness.Usually these medicines such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), peramivir (Rapivab), or zanamivir (Relenza) are best if taken within 48 hours of onset of the flu, but can still work if taken later. However, these drugs can have more pronounced side effects. Consult with your doctor about these drugs or if you need medicine for another illness.

2," Identify the buyer, seller, and the reason for the contract., Provide a description of the vehicle., Be sure that the information is accurate., State the date of the sale and the purchase price., Indicate the delivery method., Describe the condition of the vehicle., Explain what document the Seller will provide to the Buyer., Specify the status of the title., Sign and date the contract.",How to Write a Contract for Selling a Car2," The first sentence of the contract should identify the full legal names of both the buyer and the seller and state that the contract is for the sale of a car. For example, “This is a contract made between the Seller, Joe Smith, and the buyer, Dan Jones, for the sale of Joe Smith’s 1995 Honda Civic sedan.”   Provide the buyer’s and seller’s addresses as well. You may also want to provide the driver license numbers of both the buyer and the seller for identification and verification purposes.  , Use as many identifying characteristics of the car as possible.Be specific; if the contract only identifies the model and year of the car as “1990 Toyota Camry” and the owner has two 1990 Toyota Camrys, it would be unclear which car the contract means. Include as many of the following details as possible:   Color Year Make and model Body type (pickup, SUV, 4 door sedan) Interior color Any other unique features of the car (including cosmetic or mechanical problems) Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) Odometer reading For example, “The vehicle is a silver 1995 Honda Civic LX with black leather interior and a sunroof. The VIN number is 123456789 and the odometer reads 167,000 as of March 14, 2011.”  , Fraudulent claims about the details of the car or the terms of the sale can lead a contract to be voidable. Be sure that all parties understand each other and that no one is misrepresenting the vehicle or the funds that will be exchanged for the vehicle.For example, if the owner of the car notes that the car has 167,000 miles on it in the contract, but knows that the vehicle actually has 200,000 miles and a faulty odometer, the entire contract may be voided. If the odometer has ever been replaced or repaired, state this in the contract. You can use the following boilerplate language: “I certify that the car’s odometer was altered for repair or replacement purposes while in my possession, and that the mileage registered on the repaired or replaced odometer was identical to that before service.”, Describe the method of payment for the purchase—cash, personal check, cashier’s check, money order, etc.For example, “The date of sale is March 14, 2011. Buyer agrees to pay to Seller the purchase price of $500 to be paid in cash.”   Though not recommended, you can also stipulate an agreed to payment plan. For example, the buyer might pay $250/month for sixteen months. Only agree to a payment plan if you know the person to whom you are selling the car. A common fraud scheme is for someone to give an initial payment, then take the vehicle and disappear. If you do agree to a payment plan, be sure that you hold the car’s title until the payments have all been made in full. After all payments are complete, you can send the title to the new owner via certified mail. State whether the purchase price is inclusive of sales taxes. In some states, you must charge sales tax. You can state in the contract that your purchase price includes this sales tax (“inclusive of all sales taxes”), or decide that sales tax is additional to the price (“exclusive of all sales taxes”).  , If the car sale is not local, the delivery method and responsibility should be included in the contract. Options include: shipping the vehicle,delivery by the seller, pick-up by the buyer, or delivery by a third party. If expenses will be incurred during delivery (such as with shipping the vehicle or return flight or rental car for an owner delivery), the contract should indicate who is responsible for paying the delivery expenses.   Make everything clear. For example, if you live in Georgia and will drive the sold car to the buyer’s home in Alabama and then fly home, state who will be responsible for the gas to drive the car to Alabama and for your flight home: “Seller will drive the car to Buyer’s home in Alabama and agrees to pay for all gas and maintenance costs until delivery is made. Buyer agrees to pay Seller’s flight home at a cost of $175.”  , Sellers usually sell cars “as is,” which limits the seller’s liability for any problems with the car’s condition. A statement that the car is sold “as is” and that the owner “makes no warranties about the condition of the car” is sufficient.Boilerplate language regarding the condition of the vehicle can read as follows: “The is being sold “as is” and the Seller expressly disclaims any and all warranties expressed or implied. The Seller disclaims any warranty as to the condition or working order of the car. The Seller assumes no liability in connection with with the sale of the car.”, State that the Seller will provide the Buyer with the vehicle’s title and any other required documents, such as a recent emissions test report or service records. Contact your state’s DMV regarding any other documentation that a seller must provide a buyer.  , An owner may only sell a vehicle if it has a clear title, which means that there are no liens on the title for car loans or other legal action against the owner. In some cases, a seller can sell a car when the bank still holds the title (i.e., the seller still owes money on the car).   You can include “boilerplate” language to indicate the status of the title if you own the car, such as the following: “The Seller warrants that 1) the Seller is the legal owner of the car; 2) the car is free from all liens and encumbrances; 3) the Seller has full right and authority to sell and transfer the car; and 4) the Seller will warrant and defend the title of the car against any and all claims and demands of all persons.”Get a payoff letter from the financing company if you are still making payments on the car. This will provide exactly the amount of money that you still owe on the car, and which your buyer must pay to purchase the car.In most cases where a bank holds the vehicle title, the buyer writes one check directly to the bank for the payoff amount and another check to the seller for the remaining amount between the payoff and the sales price. In this case, the bank can usually mail the title to the buyer upon receiving the correct payoff amount., Each party should sign and date the contract. Make a copy of the contract after everyone signs. One party should retain the original and one party should retain a copy. It does not matter who retains the copy versus the original. A witness should also sign the contract after each party has signed the contract. Though it may not be legally required to have a witness to the sale of a car in most states,having a witness to the contract may mitigate legal disputes about the accuracy of the contract. You can also sign the contract in front of a notary, if you wish. This adds another layer of protection, as the notary provides solid evidence that both of you are who you claimed and that you both agreed to the terms of the contract.","- Identify full legal names of buyer and seller
- Provide addresses and driver license numbers
- Include detailed characteristics of the car (color, year, make, model, body type, interior color, VIN, odometer reading)

3," Give Gravedigger items to the Pig King., Wait for an earthquake in the Caverns., Kill the Bunnymen you find in the Caverns., Go fishing in the Ruins.",How to Farm Gold in Don’t Starve2," Sometimes, you’ll find large patches of raised soil every now and then when exploring the world, or some headstones lying around in the Forest. Those are graves, and you can dig those up with a Shovel, which you can make for 2 Twigs and 2 Flint in your Science Machine. If you’ve dug up some graves and found some odd little things, you can take them to the Pig King, and chances are, he’ll accept them for quite a few pieces of Gold, normally more than what most Meats can net you.   The items you might dig up from graves include knots, buttons, toys, and a lawn gnome, which apparently amuses the Pig King immensely, judging by the amount of Gold he hands you. Graves, and therefore items from them, are non-renewable and scarce in the original game, however, and must be considered as a sort of last resort if you need a lot of Gold at once. In the Reign of the Giants DLC of the PC edition and the console edition, these items can sometimes be found by breaking open Tumbleweeds in the Desert, but it’s still not very reliable despite the yield.  , Caverns are found by mining a large, craggy boulder called a Plugged Sinkhole you sometimes encounter while exploring, and going down the revealed hole in the ground. An earthquake would naturally and randomly happen underground, and would normally net you a small amount of Gold once it ends, though you’d have to be careful during it as rocks are constantly falling and will damage the player when hit with a falling rock.   You can sometimes trigger earthquakes by detonating Gunpowder and Slurtle Slime while in the Caverns. You can make Gunpowder by combining a Rotten Egg, Charcoal, and Nitre, and you can get Slurtle Slime by killing Slurtles, which look like an odd combination of turtle and slug, or feeding them plenty of Rocks.  , Sometimes, when exploring the Caverns, you will encounter giant white rabbits hopping around, or a carrot-shaped house. These Bunnymen are the underground equivalent of the Pigs, which means you could befriend them with carrots and they will aid you for as long as their loyalty lasts. You can also kill them by hitting them with a weapon or tool, or by letting them fight monsters for you. Killing them will net you a carrot, a piece of meat, and occasionally, a Bunny Puff, which you can trade to the Pig King for 2 Gold Nuggets. However, it’s an uncommon drop from the Bunnymen despite its worth.  , The Ruins is a layer lower than the Caverns and accessed by mining an orange pile of rock and going down in the resulting hole. When you find a pond and fish in the Ruins, you’ll get an Eel, which is renewable and worth a good 5 Gold Nuggets each when traded to the Pig King, unlike other Meat items. Fishing in the Ruins is reserved for late-game ventures, though, since the area is very dangerous.  ","- Graves can be dug up for items that can be traded for gold with the Pig King
- Caverns can be found by mining a Plugged Sinkhole, where earthquakes can occur and yield gold
- Bunnymen in the Caverns can be befriended or killed for valuable items
- The Ruins is a dangerous area where fishing can yield valuable Eels for trade with the Pig King"
4," Identify troubling situations., Step back from your thoughts., Challenge negative thoughts., Find support., Get professional help.",How to Prevent Negative People from Hurting Your Confidence2," Think about the people that seem to deflate your confidence. Again, understand that their words are more a reflection of their own inadequacies, and not yours. Realize that negative thoughts about yourself are coming from someone else’s opinion of you.Remember that you control your opinion of yourself, not others.  , Challenge the accuracy of negative thoughts and feelings. When you are experiencing a wave of negative thoughts, write them down in a personal diary so you can observe them and challenge them. Cognitive behavioral therapy can also be a helpful way to change negative thoughts, so you might look into a self-help book such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Dummies by Rhena Branch and Rob Willson. Negative thoughts can be:All or nothing thinking, for example, “If I do not succeed, then I am a total failure.” Jumping to negative conclusions, for example, “I made a mistake today and now everyone will think I am not qualified for this job,” or “My boss (or friend) hasn’t replied so I must have done something to make them angry.” Mistaking feelings for facts, for example, “I feel like a failure so I must be one.” Not giving yourself the credit you deserve, for example, “I only did well because it was easy.”  , Challenge negative ways of thinking with positive ways of thinking. Get outside of your head by responding to your thoughts as if you are a helpful friend or family member. Then, imagine what they would tell you, and tell yourself those things. Adjust your thoughts by:Using hopeful statements, like, “Even though it is tough, I can handle it.” Forgiving yourself, for example, “I made a mistake, but everyone makes mistakes. That is how you learn and grow.” Avoiding ""should"" and ""must"" statements, for example, “I should have done better,” “I must be a failure.” Replace them with more realistic expectations, like, “I should be proud because I did my best,” or “My presentation might not have been perfect, but my audience remained engaged and asked questions.”  , To help you get perspective on the issue, speak with a friend or family member that is removed from the situation. This way, they can give you an unbiased opinion. Make sure it is someone that you trust and that you know will listen and support you.You can say, ""My confidence has been really low lately, and this person in my life is not helping. The way they react makes me feel worse than I did before. What should I do?""  , If you are taking things that people say about you seriously, then this may indicate that you have adopted some negative beliefs about yourself. It is important to deal with these right away to avoid letting them take hold. If you can’t seem to shake negative thoughts or people, then speak to a professional therapist. Talking with someone is beneficial because it will help you redirect the negative energy instead of bottling it up, or letting it out on others or yourself.A professional will be able to help you uproot self-confidence issues.  ","- Negative thoughts about yourself are often a reflection of someone else's opinion, not your own
- Challenge negative thoughts and feelings by writing them down and seeking cognitive behavioral therapy
- Replace negative thoughts with positive, hopeful statements and realistic expectations
- Seek perspective and support from trusted friends or family members
- If negative beliefs persist, seek help from a professional therapist"
5," Drop everything., Move horizontally., Lay back., Take your time., Relax., Get on your back and ""swim."", Use a stick., Take frequent breaks., Recognize common quicksand areas., Look for ripples., Test the ground in front of you with your walking stick.",How to Get out of Quicksand," If you step into quicksand and you're wearing a backpack or carrying something heavy, immediately take off your backpack or drop what you're carrying. Because your body is less dense than quicksand, you can't fully sink unless you panic and struggle too much or you're weighed down by something heavy.   If it's possible to get out of your shoes, do so. Shoes, especially those with flat, inflexible soles (many boots, for example) create suction as you try to pull them out of quicksand. If you know ahead of time that you are highly likely to encounter quicksand, change out of your boots and either go barefoot or wear shoes that you can pull your feet out of easily.; , If you feel your feet getting stuck, take a quick couple of steps backward before the quicksand takes hold. It usually takes a minute for the mix to liquify, which means the best method of getting yourself unstuck is to not get stuck in the first place.   If your feet do become stuck, avoid taking big lumbering steps to try to get yourself out. Taking a big step forward might unstick one foot, but push your other farther down, making it extremely difficult to completely unstick yourself.  , Sit down and lean back if your feet are stuck fast. Creating a larger ""footprint"" should free your feet by removing the pressure they create, allowing them to float. When you feel them start to come free, roll to your side away from the quicksand and free of its grip. You'll get dirty, but its the quickest and safest way to free yourself., If you're stuck in quicksand, frantic movements will only hurt your cause. Whatever you do, do it slowly. Slow movements will prevent you from agitating the quicksand; vibrations caused by rapid movements can turn otherwise relatively firm ground into more quicksand.   More importantly, quicksand can react unpredictably to your movements. If you move slowly, you can more easily stop an adverse reaction and, by doing so, avoid getting yourself stuck deeper. You're going to need to be patient. Depending on how much quicksand is around you, it could take several minutes or even hours to slowly, methodically get yourself out.  , Quicksand usually isn't more than a couple feet deep, but if you do happen to come across a particularly deep spot, you could very well sink quite quickly down to your waist or chest. If you panic you can sink further, but if you relax, your body's buoyancy will cause you to float.   Breathe deeply. Not only will deep breathing help you remain calm, it will also make you more buoyant. Keep as much air in your lungs as possible. It is impossible to ""go under"" if your lungs are full of air.  , If you sink up to your hips or higher, bend backward. The more you spread out your weight, the harder it will be to sink. Float on your back while you slowly and carefully extricate your legs. Once your legs are free you can inch yourself to safety by using your arms to slowly and smoothly propel yourself backward with your arms in a sweeping motion, as if you were swimming. When you get near the edge of the quicksand, you can roll to hard ground.  , Carry a walking stick any time you're in quicksand country. As soon as you feel your ankles sink, lay the pole on the surface of the quicksand horizontally behind you. Flop onto your back on top of the pole. After a minute or two, you will achieve balance in the quicksand, and you'll stop sinking. Work the pole towards a new position; move it under your hips. The pole will prevent your hips from sinking, so you can slowly pull one leg free, then the other.   Stay flat on your back with your arms and legs fully touching the quicksand and use the pole as a guide. Inch sideways along the pole to firm ground.  , The work of extracting yourself can be exhausting, so you need to work judiciously, conserving your energy before you become too tired.   You do need to move quickly, however, as the pressure of the sand can shut off your blood flow and cause nerve damage, numbing your legs and making it almost impossible to free yourself without help. Contrary to popular movies and television, most quicksand-related fatalities do not occur because you become sucked under, but from exposure or drowning in incoming tides., While quicksand is not a unique kind of soil, it can form anywhere groundwater mixes with sandy soil, creating a distinctive soupy mixture. Learning to anticipate places you might encounter quicksand is the best way to avoid becoming entangled in it.Quicksand most commonly occurs in:   Tidal flats Swamps and marshes Near lake shores Near underground springs  , Be on the lookout for ground that appears unstable and wet, or sand that has unnatural looking ""ripples"" in the texture. You should be able to see water seeping up from below the sand, making quicksand quite visible if you're on the lookout as you're hiking around.  , Always bring a hefty walking stick, both to use in case you become stuck, but also to tap the ground in front of you as you walk. A few seconds with a walking stick could be the difference between a messy wrestling match with a pool of quicksand and a safe hike.  ","- Quicksand is less dense than the human body
- Remove heavy items if stuck in quicksand
- Shoes can create suction in quicksand

They may hold meetings or seminars where you’ll learn valuable garden knowledge. Clubs also usually tend a community garden where you can get hands on experience with various plants.  If you can’t find an official club, ask around your friends and family to see if anyone works a garden that you could come and check out.  , Search the business directory for plant farms near you. Give them a call and ask if you could spend a few hours a week working with them. Just watching how they tend the plants will teach you a lot. Work the plants if they will let you., If you are interested in starting a new job path, or you have some free time to pick up part-time work, look for nursery jobs. Your job would consist of growing plants and transplanting them to their new homes.  This type of work requires you to be outside and do a lot of bending and heavy lifting. Make sure you are physically fit enough for this type of work.  , One of the best ways to learn is by doing. So find a garden spot in your yard, till up the soil, and plant some seeds. You may not succeed with all of the plants at first, but you’ll learn a lot along the way. Find a few food plants or flowers that you are interested in, and buy seeds to start up your garden.","1.

7," Observe the patient., Weigh the patient., Discuss pain levels., Take a reading of oxygen saturation.",How to Check Vitals4," Don't forget to observe the patient while taking readings to see if they seem worried. Have them sit in a relaxed position with their legs uncrossed. Pay attention to see if they are in obvious distress or if they have something wrong with them that's visible to the naked eye., Sometimes, weight is included in vital signs. To weigh a patient, ask them to get on a scale, and then write down the number. Make no judgment on the person's weight, whether by comment, facial expression, or body language., For this vital, you'll need to ask the person how they are feeling and to rate their pain on a scale from 0-10. Of course, everyone's pain scale will be different, but if you can get a good idea of what level of pain the person is having, that helps assess their overall condition.First say, ""Are you in any pain?"" If the answer is ""yes,"" ask ""Can you rate your pain on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt?""  , Oxygen saturation is how much oxygen is in your blood. It is an important indicator of whether the patient is breathing properly and/or pumping blood to the body properly. A simple device that fits over the patient's fingernail will give you a reading for oxygen saturation, which normally is at 95 to 100 percent.","- Observing the patient's physical state and body language while taking vital signs is important
- Patients should be asked to sit in a relaxed position with legs uncrossed during readings
- Weight may be included in vital signs, but judgment should not be passed on the patient's weight
- Assessing a patient's pain level on a scale of 0-10 is important in determining their overall condition
- Oxygen saturation is a crucial indicator of proper breathing and blood circulation, with a normal range of 95 to 100 percent"
8," Learn the vowels., Identify consonant groups., Acquaint yourself with the nasal groups., Make sense of the Japanese ""Y"" group., Study the tail end groups of hiragana., Avoid particle confusion., Memorize hiragana symbols., Build your vocabulary through reading.",How to Learn to Read Japanese2," Five vowels form the basis of hiragana. These are: あ, い, う, え, and お (a, i, u, e, o). Almost all consonants in Japanese pair with these five vowels to make up consonant groups of five symbols. These groups often have voiced and unvoiced members, which will be further explained later.   An example of a consonant group is the ""K"" group. The consonant sound of this group combines with each vowel to make the five symbols: か (ka), き (ki), く (ku), け (ke), and こ (ko)., Groups are easier to remember because they're unvoiced (V-) symbols are only differentiated from voiced (V+) symbols by a quote-like mark (〃) or a small circle (゜). Voiced consonants in a group will make your throat vibrate, and unvoiced consonants will not.   V-: か, き, く, け, こ (ka, ki, ku, ke, ko) V+: が, ぎ, ぐ, げ, ご (ga, gi, gu, ge, go) V-: さ, し, す, せ, そ (sa, shi, su, se, so) V+: ざ, じ, ず, ぜ, ぞ (za, ji, zu, ze, zo) V-: た, ち, つ, て, と (ta, chi, tsu, te, to) V+: だ, ぢ, づ, で, ど (da, ji, zu, de, do) V-: は, ひ, ふ, へ, ほ (ha, hi, fu, he, ho) V+: ば, び, ぶ, べ, ぼ (ba, bi, bu, be, bo) V+: ぱ, ぴ, ぷ, ぷ, ぽ (pa, pi, pu, pe, po), A nasal is a sound like an ""m"" or an ""n."" These sounds vibrate in the top-back of your throat and into your nasal cavity. Japanese has two nasal groups in hiragana:   な, に, ぬ, ね, の (na, ni, nu, ne, no) ま, み, む, め, も (ma, mi, mu, me, mo), The ""Y"" group in Japanese can blend with consonant symbols that end in an い (i) sound (like き, じ, ひ / ki, ji, hi). This is represented by the consonant symbol followed by a small ""Y"" group symbol. The ""Y"" group has no unvoiced members.   The ""Y"" group: や, ゆ, よ (ya, yu, yo) Some common ""Y"" group blends: しゃ (sha), じゃ (ja), にゃ (nya), きゅ (kyu), ぎゅ (gyu), しゅ (shu), ひょ (hyo), びょ(byo), and しょ (sho)., Traditionally, the ""R"" group is taught last along with three unique symbols. Neither of these two end groups have unvoiced members. All ""r"" sounds should be pronounced similar to the ""t"" sound in ""water.""The ""R"" group: ら, り, る, れ,ろ (ra, ri, ru, re, ro) The unique three: わ, を, ん (wa, wo, n), Particles are a special part of Japanese grammar. There is no English equivalent, though it can help to think of particles like prepositions. Particles indicate the grammatical role words play in a sentence, and sometimes have a different pronunciation than you'd expect.   For instance, in the sentence, ""I go to school,"" the word ""I"" is the topic and ""school"" a destination, so it is written,「わたしはがっこにいきます」(watashi wa (I + topic particle) gakko ni (school + direction particle) ikimasu (go)). There are many particles in Japanese, but the most common include:  は (pronounced wa): topic marker. か (ka): indicates a question at the end of a sentence. が (ga): subject marker. に (ni): indicates location, movement, marks time and the indirect object. の (no): indicates the word before の is possessive of the word following it. へ (e): indicates direction (of movement). を (o): marks the direct object., The shape of hiragana symbols can be very foreign if you don't have experience writing in a similar Asian script. Practice regularly to improve your recall so that you can read these symbols quickly, fluently, and correctly.   You may want to make flash cards to help study. Write each symbol on one side of an index card and the pronunciation of the symbol on the opposite side., Many children's books and beginning learner Japanese materials are written solely in hiragana. By reading materials like these, you'll be sure to pick up some new vocab terms as you practice.You may want to make flash cards for new words, too. You can mix these in with your hiragana flash cards to add variety to your study.Some websites publish articles or simple stories in hiragana for beginning learners.

The weak muscles are usually most noticeable in the torso area. The child may also appear to have floppy limbs or a floppy body. The baby may also have a weak or soft cry.This is usually apparent at birth or right after birth. The floppiness or weakened muscles may get better or go away after a few months.; , Another common problem for children with PWS is feeding difficulties. The child may not be able to suck properly, so they will need assistance to feed. Because of the difficulties feeding, the child has slow growth development or a failure to grow.You may have to employ the use of feeding tubes or purchase special nipples to help the child suck properly. This generally causes a difficulty for the infant to thrive. These sucking problems may improve after a few months.  , As the child ages, they may experience rapid and excessive weight gain. This is generally due to problems with the pituitary gland and hormonal issues. The child may overeat, be hungry all the time, or have a food obsession, which adds to the weight gain.This generally occurs between ages one and six. The child may end up classified as obese.  , Another symptom of PWS is abnormal facial features. This includes almond shaped eyes, thin upper lips, narrowing at the temples, and a down turning of the mouth. The child may also have an upturned nose., Another developmental symptom of PWS is delayed development of the sexual organs. Often children with PWS have hypogonadism, which means they have underactive testicles or ovaries. This causes a reduced development of their genitalia.In females, they may have abnormally small vaginal lips and clitoris. In males, they may have a small scrotum or penis. They may have delayed or incomplete puberty. This also can lead to infertility.  , Children with PWS may display the signs of developmental delays. This may present as a minor or moderate intellectual disability, or the child may have learning disabilities. They may not do common physical developmental tasks until much later, such as sitting or walking.The child may test at an IQ of 50 to 70. Children may have difficulties with speech development.  , Reduced movement is a minor symptom of PWS. This may occur during pregnancy. The fetus may not have moved or kicked in the womb as much as normal. After the baby is born, he or she may display a lack of energy or extreme lethargy, which may be associated with a weak cry., If a child has PWS, they may have problems sleeping. They may be extremely sleepy during the day. They also may not sleep through the entire night, but experience disruptions while sleeping.The child may have sleep apnea.  , Children with Prader-Willi Syndrome may exhibit an array of behavior problems. They may throw excessive temper tantrums or be more stubborn than other kids. They may engage in lying or stealing, which is often related to food.The children may also show symptoms associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and even engage in actions like skin picking., There are a few physical symptoms that are minor criteria which help doctors diagnose PWS. Children with unusually fair, light, or pale hair, skin, or eyes are at a greater risk. Children may have crossed eyes or near-sightedness.The child may also show physical abnormalities, such as small or narrowed hands and feet. They also may be unusually short for their age.Children may have unusually thick or sticky saliva.  , Other less common symptoms may present in children with Prader-Willi Syndrome. This includes the inability to vomit and a high threshold for pain. They may have problems with their bones, such as scoliosis (a curvature of the spine) or osteoporosis (brittle bones).They may also have an early puberty because of abnormal activity in the adrenal glands.  , Doctors use the major and minor criteria to determine if Prader-Willi Syndrome is a possible condition for your child. Looking for these symptoms can help you determine if your child should be tested or examined by a doctor.For children two and under, a total of five points is needed to be tested. Three to four points must be from the major criteria symptoms, with the others coming from the minor symptoms. Children three and over must score at least eight points. Four to five points need to be from the major symptoms., One good way to get your child diagnosed for Prader-Willi Syndrome early is to take them to their scheduled check ups after they are born. The doctor can track their development and start to notice any problems.During any of the visits during your child’s early years, the doctor may use the symptoms noticed during the exam to diagnose PWS.In these appointments, the doctor checks the child’s growth, weight, muscle tone and movement, genitals, and head circumference. The doctor also routinely monitors the child's development. You should tell the doctor if your child has problems eating or sucking, if there are problems sleeping, or if they seem like they have less energy than they should. If your child is older, tell your doctor about any food obsessions or habits of overeating you notice in your child.  , If the doctor suspects PWS, they will perform a genetic blood test. This blood test will confirm that your child has PWS. The test will look for abnormalities on chromosome 15. If there is a history of PWS in your family, you can also get prenatal testing to check your baby for PWS.The genetic test can also help you figure out if you may have other children with the same condition.","1. Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is characterized by weak muscles and lack of muscle tone, feeding difficulties, rapid weight gain, abnormal facial features, delayed development of sexual organs, developmental delays, reduced movement, sleep problems, and behavior problems.

2. Children with PWS may exhibit symptoms such as floppy limbs, difficulty sucking, slow growth development, excessive weight gain, abnormal facial features, delayed sexual organ development, intellectual disabilities, and speech delays.

3. Diagnosis of PWS is based on major and minor criteria symptoms, with children needing to score a certain number of points to be tested depending on their age.

4. Early diagnosis of PWS is important, and regular check-ups with a doctor can help track the child's development and identify any potential issues.

5. Genetic blood tests can confirm a diagnosis of PWS by looking for abnormalities on chromosome 15. Prior history of PWS in the family may warrant prenatal testing for future children."

Be prepared for any kind of response. It is also a good idea to talk with them when your schedule is relatively open, in case they want to head out shopping right away., If the person asks why you need a bra, you might want to talk about the activities that you are involved in that require a great deal of movement. This means that you are not only asking for a bra for personal reasons, but for health ones as well.   For example, you could tell them about how you play basketball and how you need more chest support as you are running around the court.  , If you’ve noticed that many of your friends have recently gotten bras, you might mention this as well. However, just be sure to reassure the person you’re asking that you are not giving in to peer pressure, you actually need a bra. But, putting everything into context as part of puberty may make this transition easier for all involved.   You might say, “All of my friends are currently wearing bras and, from talking with them, I think that it is a good time for me to start doing it as well.”  , This is a good way to break the ice too. Ask if they would like to go shopping with you and then head to a department store. Then, browse around the racks like usual, but make your way to the lingerie and undergarments section.Looking through the bra offerings of a large store can be a bit overwhelming, so before you go it is a good idea to hop online and browse through the various styles and sizes available.  , If this is the case, you may want to ask again after a few days have passed. Or, you can save up some money and see if you can purchase one on your own.Try to be conservative in what you ask for initially. Don’t request an elaborate or expensive push-up bra. Instead, keep your requests fairly minimal.  , If you are simply too nervous to talk, then compose a quick letter to your parent or guardian in which you ask them to help you select and purchase a bra. Keep the letter brief and to-the-point. State your request in a polite way and then explain your reasoning. Make sure to tell them whether you would prefer a written or verbal response.   For example, you might write, “I think I need a bra because my chest frequently hurts when we play sports in school. I think that I could use the additional support that a bra would provide.”  ","- Asking for a bra may lead to more conversations or sharing experiences

13," Begin teaching basic commands as early as possible., Use a reward method to train your puppy., Use a delicate touch when using a disciplining method of training.",How to Take Care of a Puppy6," It is never too early to start practicing them. By establishing the basic commands, your puppy can build a foundation for learning to play games and get along with other people and dogs. Actions such as sit, down, stay, & come can be extremely useful when you need to get your puppy's attention. Teaching them these things also helps to establish roles in the relationship.    Teach your dog to come.  Teach your dog to sit.  Teach your dog to lie down. After mastering basic commands, such as these, you can start practicing other tricks such as shake, rollover, and speak.  , When trying to let your puppy know that it is behaving appropriately or responding to a given command well, try using a reward method to get your message across to it. Reward your puppy with small treats that are given to them immediately following a good behavior or response to a command. Another form of reward is a gentle pat on the head or rub behind the ear while you say ""Good boy"" or ""Good girl"".   This attention and positive reinforcement lets your puppy know that when it behaves this way or responds to a command in this way, it will receive a reward. Be firm in your commands and strict with your treat disbursement. Don't just give the puppy treats at random times of the day or it won't learn that it has to work for its treats. Choose healthy treats that are specially formulated for puppies. Don't give it leftover dinner scraps that it may not be able to digest easily.  , Disciplining your puppy can be a tricky way of letting them know good from bad behavior. When using a discipline method to train your puppy, you need to discipline it each time it behaves badly, which can be hard to follow through with if you are not watching your puppy all of the time.   Although it may not be the best way to train and teach your puppy good behavior, some discipline methods include a light mist from a spray bottle, a quick and sudden noise like a hand clap, or a firm ""No"". Each of these methods should get the attention of your puppy and distract them from the bad or unwanted behavior they were displaying.","- Start practicing basic commands early

The tape will protect the lower half of your nails from the new color. Choose another shade of polish for the tips. Apply the new shade to the exposed nail tips, which will create a color-block effect.When choosing the new polish, you can stay within the same color family or choose a contrasting hue for a more unique look. Do not remove the tape until the new polish has dried completely.  , Choose three or four different nail polish colors, mixing and matching the hues in whatever way you see fit. Apply the polishes one at a time by swiping, drizzling, swirling and dabbing them on. Don’t worry about being too neat and tidy with this.

They will be able to provide with you guidance on whether or not this program is appropriate for you.   Start by talking to your doctor about your desire to lose weight by following the 20/20 diet. Bring in the book, recipes and allowed food lists so your doctor can familiarize himself with this eating plan. In general, the 20/20 diet can be viewed as a well-balanced diet; however, the initial phase (which is short in length) is fairly restrictive. Talk to your doctor specifically about this phase of the diet and whether he thinks it'd be safe for you. Ask your doctor whether or not he has additional guidance, advice or resources on safe and healthy weight loss for you.; , Like many diets, the 20/20 diet is fairly specific — especially in the initial phases. To help make your transition to this diet a little easier, write out your meal plan and a corresponding grocery list.Start by reviewing the allowed foods for whatever phase you're following. Also review the corresponding recipes that incorporate these allowed foods. To make your meal plan, take a calendar or date book and write in what you plan to eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner and any planned snacks. Do this for one week at a time. Review your meal plan and recipes and write up a corresponding grocery list. This will help keep you on track in the grocery store and prevent you from purchasing things you don't need.  , In addition to following a specific eating plan in the 20/20 diet, Dr. Phil also suggests setting up an exercise schedule. He gives some specifics in the diet to help support your weight loss.   The first thing to do is to get clearance from your doctor. The diet recommends this and it's a general safety practice you should always follow. You need to make sure exercise is safe and appropriate for you. Consider joining an exercise program at a gym, working with a personal trainer, buy some fitness DVDs or watch them for free online, or just start walking for 30 minutes every day. As you become more familiar with which exercises you enjoy, try to write out an exercise schedule for yourself week by week (you can ask a trainer to help you with this, too). It should be similar to your meal plan. Write out what type of exercise you want to do and for how long on each day of the week. In phase one, it's recommended to start by increasing your steps and overall endurance. This is especially important if you haven't been overly active previously.However, if you're already in fairly good shape, Dr. Phil recommends that you start the 30 second exercise plan, which is detailed in his book. This is where you do 30 second bursts of very high-intensity activity alternating with lower intensity exercises.  , In addition to the 20/20 book, there is also an app that you can download to your smartphone or tablet. This is an extra resource that may prove to be useful as well.   The 20/20 app is available for both iPhone and Android devices. It's free to install with both.The app provides a lot of the same information as the book; however, the sources are less robust as is the overall content. You can find information on each of the phases, lists of allowed foods and a variety of recipes on the app. The app also has information on performing the recommended exercises.  , To start off your weight loss on the 20/20 diet, you'll begin by entering phase one or the ""five day boost"" phase. The goal here is to help kick start your weight loss.The five day boost phase is the most restrictive part of the 20/20 diet. There is only a small list of foods that are allowed at this time. All are whole foods which are not processed and are naturally lower in carbohydrates. Start by gathering the list of foods that are allowed during this phase. They include: coconut oil, green tea, mustard, olive oil, almonds, apples, chickpeas, dried plums, prunes, leafy greens, lentils, peanut butter, pistachios, raisins, yogurt, eggs, cod, rye, tofu and whey powder. During this kick start phase, you'll need to eat four meals a day about four hours apart. Writing yourself a meal plan will help you stick to this schedule. If you purchase the 20/20 diet book, there are recipes provided for this specific phase.  , After you move through the five days of the boost phase, you'll enter phase two which is called the ""five day sustain"" phase. You'll continue your weight loss, but are now able to eat a wider variety of foods.In phase two, there are additional foods that you can eat; however, you need to continue with your current eating plan. Aim to have four meals a day about four hours apart. In addition to the approved 20 foods, you can also add: chicken breast, tuna, oats, brown rice, carrots, tomatoes, mushrooms, cashews, and blueberries. At each meal, you can add some of these new foods, however you still need to include two of the original 20 approved foods. This helps continue your weight loss. Another addition that you can do during this second phase is to incorporate two ""sensible splurges"" each week. These splurges need to be calorie controlled and total no more than 100 calories per splurge.  , Phase three or the 20 day attain phase is very similar to phase two. You do get to add in more foods and your main goal is to work towards attaining your goal weight.In this last weight loss phase of the 20/20 diet, you are able to add in even more foods. These include: avocado, raspberries, mushrooms, potatoes, spinach, quinoa, and black beans. They include more carbohydrate rich foods, but are still very nutritious and low in calories. Again, the eating plan doesn't change. You're to aim for four meals about four hours apart and can still include the two ""sensible splurges"" for 100 calories each.  , After the first three phases, you probably will have lost a significant amount of weight; however, to decide whether or not you should transition to maintenance, decide whether you want to continue with further weight loss.   The 20/20 diet recommends that you evaluate your weight after phase three comes to an end. Do you still want to lose more weight? Or are you content with your current weight loss? If you'd like to lose more weight, it's recommended that you restart from phase one and go through all three phases again. Repeat this sequence until you've hit your desired goal weight.If you're content with your weight loss, you can transition to phase four which focuses mostly on weight maintenance.  , The last and final phase of the 20/20 diet is the maintenance phase. This is the final phase and the habits and eating patterns you've adopted shouldn't change.   In order to prevent you from regaining the weight, the 20/20 diet recommends that you stay in phase three (with the occasional sensible splurge) long-term. You're encouraged to continue trying new recipes and monitoring your diet so that you stay on track with the four meals daily about four hours apart. Another important phase of maintenance is the continued work on your relationship with food and managing your desires to eat.  , When you've hit your goal weight after following the 20/20 diet, there are many lifestyle habits that you'll need to continue in order to maintain that weight. One of the is regular and consistent physical activity.   Research shows that one of the best ways to maintain a healthy weight or a weight loss is by including regular physical activity.The 20/20 diet in addition to most health professionals will recommend that you include at least 150 minutes of cardiovascular activity each week. Also include one to two days of strength training in addition to your cardio. For cardio, you can try: the 20/20 diet's high-intensity interval training program, running, walking, using the elliptical, hiking, dancing or taking a spin class. For resistance training, try: lifting weights or taking a yoga or pilates class.  , One place that many dieters slip up, is when they increase how much they snack or cheat during their maintenance phase. Too much of this behavior can cause weight regain.   The 20/20 diet specifically emphasizes that you should monitor your splurges and cheats. It allows you two sensible splurges long-term, so use those wisely and make sure you stay accountable to those two splurges.You may want to keep a food journal or diary during your maintenance phase. This can help you plan for and remember splurges so that you don't overdo it. If you do notice some weight regain, one of the first places you should evaluate is the amount of splurges you've been having.  , One unique aspect of the 20/20 diet is the emphasis on emotional eating and your relationship with food. It suggests continually monitoring this relationship and to work on controlling your cravings and desires to eat when you're feeling upset.The 20/20 diet says that your emotions play a big part in how much you eat and what you choose to eat. You need to continue to be aware of this so you don't fall back into old habits. The book associated with this particular diet gives a lot of great advice and tips on how to continually manage this aspect of your weight loss. For example, if you have a craving for junk food, try drinking a glass of water and going on a walk to help distract you from the craving. Or you could brush your teeth, which might keep you from indulging (and help support your oral health!).  , In addition to regular exercise and sticking to a sensible eating plan long-term, it's also recommended that you weigh yourself regularly and to track your weight long-term.   The 20/20 book and many health professionals note that when you weigh in regularly and keep track of your weight, you're more likely to continue losing weight and have a much better time maintaining your weight loss.Try to get on the scale one time per week, long-term. Weighing daily isn't necessary since day to day fluctuations in weight are common and don't necessarily reflect an accurate overall trend. If you notice your weight creeping up over time, revisit your exercise schedule and food journal to see what's causing your weight gain. You'll need to adjust what you're eating so your weight starts to go back down.  ","1. Before starting any diet, consult with your doctor first for guidance.
2. The 20/20 diet is well-balanced but has a restrictive initial phase.
3. Write out meal plans and grocery lists to stay on track.
4. Exercise is recommended to support weight loss, get clearance from your doctor.

You can inspire Sims by fulfilling their needs. To see a Sims' needs, select him or her and look at the bars. If the Sim is hungry, use the fridge to eat. If the Sim is low on Fun, rest by watching TV or playing on the computer. If your Sims' social needs are low, try petting your dog, talking to other Sims on the phone, or meeting them in person.   You can quickly and easily raise your Sim's Energy by drinking espresso. You don't actually need to sleep if you use this constantly! When interacting with other Sims, ""Be Funny"" will usually raise the bar to the maximum. You can purchase Cupcakes for LP that will make your Sims inspired, or you can buy a Cocktail at the Nightclub for Simoleons.; , Buy a stove, and sell some baked goodies. Start off by baking cookies or pancakes and when you've made your baking skill really high, you can bake chocolate cake! It takes a lot of time and patience to earn a lot of money this way, but it can still be worth it and it also earns you lifestyle points.  , After the dog digs up Lifestyle Points, praise him so he knows that he will get praised if he digs up Lifestyle Points. This will mean more rewards for you later. You can also buy the bone for 2LP for your dog. It will get you Simoleons and LPs faster.   The more expensive your cat or dog is, the faster it will gather Simoleons and LP. If your dog doesn't have the dig/pounce sign on it, get a toddler to play with it or an adult to praise it. Do this twice and it should run or slowly walk away. Usually this will lead it to find something, and repeating the process can get you even more stuff.  , When your Sims go to work, they earn money, which they keep. Also, when you go to work regularly, you get promoted, which will earn more Simoleons and XP after a work day.   Working regularly will help you achieve a large number of the goals in the game as well.  , When they are completed, you will earn more money depending on what you grew. Overnight, while you're asleep, have your Sims gardening (all the ones who aren't at work or busy). If you garden 7 or 8 hour crops at night, you'll wake up to lots of Simoleons and XP. Make sure they are inspired because they'll earn 1.5X the Simoleons.   Try planting bell pepper seeds, as bell pepper seeds are free and it only takes 30 seconds for them to grow and be ready to sell! After they are ready you can sell them for a few Simoleons. You can dedicate one lot in your town to gardening. Place at least one garden on the lot per Sim in your town. Get all or most of your Sims inspired at once, and take them all to the lot to garden.  , Buy the Community Center at the top left of your town map. Do hobbies like fashion designing, ghost hunting, and figure skating. All of these are the hobbies that will get you rewards and one big reward when you complete their collections.  , Earn some extra Lifestyle Points or XP by competing at the Competition Center (added with the Supernatural update). You can compete between all the active hobbies: ballet, karate or ghost hunting. You can choose a specific Sim that's going to compete for the next 12 hours. You need to level up your skills to win a higher place, which in turn leads to bigger rewards.  , If you are in the middle of baking something that takes a long time, and you need money fast, getting two ovens will help. Don't buy the expensive ones if you are not too rich though, because it doesn't let you bake any faster.  , When you go for a drive, it can earn you money and lifestyle points. Quickly tapping on the music notes will earn you bonus money. Sometimes you'll even be lucky enough to get LP.  , If you don't let the Sims go to the bathroom, they will wet their pants. Cleaning it up will earn you points. Similarly, if you shake your device, your Sims will get sick and throw up. If you clean up the vomit, you can earn points. Doing this too often might make your device freeze up, so use it sparingly.  , Be smart about what you buy. Don't waste your money on anything you won't use. Like in real life, this habit is key to a successful budget.   Save items you can reuse. Put a cradle in the inventory once a baby's born. Other couples can use it and it saves money so you don't have to buy a new one. Be ready for a rainy day. Save up your LP because some of your tasks require them. Once you complete the task, you'll get some back. You don't want to be stuck because you spent all your LP on something you didn't really need! Be careful of spending real money. Don't waste your real money for Simoleons and LPs. You can earn plenty if you're patient, and spending real money on this can become a habit.  , Go to the purple trolley and press ""Free"" on the top left. It will bring up short programs or videos and if you watch them, you will earn one LP. These won't earn you much, but the videos change regularly, giving you a constant stream of LP.  , The Sims FreePlay Facebook page will often have special offers and giveaways. If you Like the Facebook page, you will be updated every time there is a new event. You can earn Simoleans, LP, and a variety of other items this way.  , If you click on your stove, you can select cooking or baking. If you select cooking, you can start this hobby and cook food for your sims. It is like a regular hobby, but you will get a plate of food for your sims to eat.  Make sure that you have the right appliances (3 star stove, 2 star toaster,ect,) for the food you are trying to cook, or else you won't be able to cook it. Each food item costs Simoleons and takes time. The longer it takes to make the food item, the more Simoleons it will probably take to cook that item. Some food items have a chance to catch your stove on fire when you're finished making them. Be careful when making these items.

20," Maximize your team's strength., Get in the right position., Take small steps backward., Push back with your legs as much as you can., Use teamwork., Keep practicing.",How to Win at Tug of War," You should put the strongest person in the back so that he can use his strength the most and will have the least chance of slipping. Some people say you should put the strongest person in front; the problem with that is that if this player slips up, you will lose your strongest player right off the bat. You can put the strongest person in the back while keeping one of the other strong players up front. In general, you should mix up your weakest and strongest players so you don't have a row of several weak players keeping you down.          If each end of your rope has a loop to place a player in, then your strongest player should go into the loop.; , First off, do not wrap the rope around your hands or wrists. This is guaranteed to harm you and possibly lead to a broken bone or a sprain. You should hold the rope with an underhand grip, keeping your arms as extended as you can so you can lean back most effectively. Remember that winning tug of war isn't about using your hands to pull the rope; it's about using your legs to push against the ground while holding onto the rope with your hands. If you plan to win just by pulling, you will get tired -- fast.          Keep your arms and body almost straight as you lean backwards with your upper body while planting your feet into the ground, using both of your legs as anchors. Pretend like you're sitting back into a seat that is very reclined. Your feet should be positioned a little wider than shoulder width apart. You and your teammates will all be positioned on one side of the rope, with your arms gripping the rope from both sides.  , Everyone should move in small baby steps so that both of the strongest muscles in the body (the thighs) can keep the rope on their side. If you take huge steps, you'll be much more likely to fall or trip. If you feel that your team is really beginning to dominate, you can do the power walk, by slowly walking backward sideways, with your chest facing the other side of the rope.         , Use all your leg muscles; arms should be locked out; don’t waste energy trying to pull with your arms or you will quickly run out of energy and will lose your grip. As you slowly walk backwards with your feet, rotate your shoulders backward slightly as you inch your arms and legs backwards. Make sure to always remain in the ""nearly falling"" seated position, and to never let your legs or body get behind your arms, so that you're scrunched up under the rope with your arms ahead of you. You won't be able to get any power from this position.         , Everyone should pull at the same time. This will generate the maximum amount of force that your team is supposedly capable of. Much like a dragon boat team, a good fluid and coordinated motion can easily propel ""the boat"", which in this case the opposing team forward.         , It may take a while for your team to find a winning rhythm. As you practice together more as a team, you will find the best coordination and the best order of team members that will lead to your success. Don't get frustrated right away; once you master the technique and the teamwork, you'll be well on your way to being tug-of-war champions!         ","1.

21," Avoid contact., Ignore them entirely., Don’t become violent., Seek legal help.",How to Get People to Leave You Alone3," There are many ways that you can avoid contact with people you don’t want to see. If you know their schedule, you can adjust your own to avoid them. The key is to avoid becoming a hermit. Don't just stay in your home all the time. Weigh the pros and cons. Should I risk seeing other people? Is that risk so great that I should just stay at home all the time?   There are even apps that can help you avoid people. An app called Cloak collects geo-positioning data from other social medias like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter and then tells you if someone you are trying to avoid is nearby.It is not foolproof, but it can be a good tool especially if you're trying to avoid a person who uses social media a lot.  , Give them the silent treatment. If you are forced to interact with someone who hasn’t responded to your subtle or direct forms of communication, you might need to resort to more obvious, non-violent measures. The silent treatment isn’t just for children. This is a rather “toxic” maneuver because it is normally perceived as very obvious and rude. It is a quick way to tell people you aren’t interested in talking to them.   In many cases, this move can backfire. If you have a person who accepts no blame for their relationship with you, they may try to irritate you into talking. You’ll have to persevere or try something else., Violence is rarely the answer, unless you need to defend yourself. It can be very tempting to strike someone who is bothering you rather than stick to your non-violent methods. You'll want to slap or punch someone who is particularly insulting or annoying, but resist the urge. Use your words not your fists.  , If your relationship has escalated to harassment and even stalking, you might consider calling the police and filing a restraining order. Restraining orders should not be filed lightly. They can have serious legal repercussions for a person. So don’t file one unless you no longer feel safe around a person. If someone has physically assaulted you or made threatening remarks to you or your loved ones, consider a restraining order. ","1. Avoiding unwanted contact with people

Each town has a specialty food item you can buy from the Chef NPCs, indicated by a hat icon hovering above them. Certain food items have certain stats they boost, like how a Golden Fried Chicken bought in Crescent Hill can improve your DMG by 231 points for an hour or how the Enthralling Baumkuchen of Demarech Mines boosts your Speed by 408 points for 30 minutes.  , If you can find some ingredients, like Fragrant Flowers or Chopped Nuts, from gatherable plants and items in the map, you can improve them even further! For example, the Golden Fried Chicken can be improved by gathering some Crescent Vanilla from the Crescent Flowers growing about near town and in the Flower Fields.

The quality, from lowest to highest, is green, orange, purple, then finally gold. Do note that fusing yourself some food costs money, in addition to what you paid to buy the food item to begin with.   Some recipes, like the Double-Colored Biscuits of Cactakara Forest and the Enthralling Baumkuchen of Demarech Mines require 2 ingredients, one of which is found in other areas. You can usually figure which ingredient can be used to improve which food item, but you won’t know if it needs another ingredient until you try to fuse the food and the ingredient.  , If you have money to spare and good reflexes, you can buy some Cooking Utensils from the Chefs for 1 Gold each.

The Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program supports the rehabilitation of historic structures of every age, size, shape and style. The goal of the program is to support rehabilitation of abandoned or underused schools, warehouses, factories, churches, retail stores, apartments, hotels, houses, and offices. The National Park Service (NPS) and the IRS administer the program in partnership with state historic-preservation offices.   The rehabilitation tax credit can reduce one's federal income tax by 20% of the amount spent in a certified rehabilitation of a certified historic structure. This is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in taxes. This program has been used to help preserve more than 40,000 historic properties in the U.S. since 1976. ; , The 20% tax credit is available only for the rehabilitation of historic and income-producing buildings that have been deemed certified historic structures by the National Park Service. The income-producing requirement generally precludes use of this credit for owner-occupied, residential properties. The credit is available to support rehabilitation of income-producing properties used for commercial, industrial, agricultural, or residential purposes. If a portion of a personal residence is used for business purposes, a homeowner may be able to apply for help with rehabilitation of that portion of the residence. ,   An owner can request a preliminary determination of historical significance from the National Park Service if the building is not yet listed on the National Register or located in a current historic district. This request can be made as part of the application for the tax-incentive program by completing Part 1 of the Historic Preservation Certification application. The application can be found on the National Park Service website. , In order for an owner to receive the 20% tax incentive, the National Park Service must approve the rehabilitation plans and certify the finished project. A certified rehabilitation means that the rehabilitation is consistent with the historic character of the property and/or the district in which the property is located.   NPS recognizes that buildings will be rehabilitated in a manner that allows for efficient commercial use. The rehabilitation must not destroy, damage or cover interior or exterior materials or features that give the building its historic significance., It is critical that you photograph all aspects of the interior and exterior of the building before you begin the project and again once the project is completed. These photographs are an important part of your application and necessary for your project to get final approval.  , Before you begin the rehabilitation you should contact your State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and discuss your proposed project. You can either download the Historic Preservation Certification application from the NPS website or request a copy from your SHPO. Review the application carefully, and submit it in the early stages of your project planning.You should not begin any rehabilitation until the project is formally approved in writing by NPS. The application has three parts: Part 1—Evaluation of Significance; Part 2—Description of Rehabilitation; Part 3—Request for Certification of Completed Work. You will submit the relevant parts of the application at different points in the rehabilitation process., The NPS requires that all applicants pay a fee. The fees are charged for the NPS review of the proposed project, as set forth in Part 2 of the application, and for review of the completed project, as set forth in Part 3 of the application. Fees vary and are based on the amount of rehabilitation planned.   You are not required to pay the fee until NPS requests payment. NPS will not issue its decision until you have paid your fees. You can access a fee schedule on the NPS website., In addition to the project requirements established by NPS, an applicant must also meet IRS requirements to be eligible for the 20% rehabilitation tax credit. These requirements include the following:   The building must be depreciable, which means that the building must be used in trade or for the production of income. The rehabilitation must be substantial, which means that during the two-year period of rehabilitation, the expenditures must exceed the greater of $5,000 or the adjusted basis of the building and its structural components. The property must be placed in service, which means that the building is presently being used for income-generation purposes. The expenditures must be considered qualified rehabilitation expenditures. These expenditures include the cost of work on the building, as well as fees for engineers and architects, site-survey fees, legal expenses, and other construction-related costs. Qualified rehabilitation expenditures do not include the building of a new addition or the provision of parking lots, sidewalks, landscaping or furnishings.  , Once you have received your NPS certification you can apply for your 20% tax credit from the IRS. You must complete IRS form 3468 for the tax year in which the rehabilitated building was put into service.   If you have not yet received your NPS certification, you must include Part 2 of the submitted application along with your tax filings. If NPS denies certification of the project, the tax credit will be disallowed. , In order to take full advantage of the IRS tax credit, you must maintain ownership of the building for at least five full years from the time the building was placed in service. If you sell the building within a year, you are responsible for repaying the entire tax credit. For properties held more than a year but less than five years, the tax credit is reduced by 20% for each year less than five you hold the property. , Generally only nonprofit organizations and public agencies are eligible to receive historic-preservation grants supported by the federal government or funded through the National Trust Preservation Fund. While you are able to register as an individual through the federal grant website, you would not be eligible to apply for historic-preservation grants.   If you are a nonprofit organization, a public agency, or a native-American tribal government, you would be eligible to apply for federal preservation grants. , In order to register with the federal grant website, you must first apply for a nine-digit Dun & Bradstreet identification number, known as ""DUNS."" You can apply for the number in the following ways:   You can call 1-866-705-5711 and register over the phone. You can register on the Dun & Bradstreet website.  , In addition to obtaining a DUNS number, you must also register your organization or agency with the System Award Management. You can register on the SAM website . You will be required to provide your organization’s name, the name of the organization’s authorized official, and the organization’s Employer Identification Number (EIN)., Once you have obtained your DUNS number and registered with SAM, you are able to register with Grants.gov. When you begin the registration process, you will be required to submit your DUNS number. Once this number has been verified, you will be able to create a username and password for your Grants.gov account.   The registration process is typically completed and approved in one day. You will be required to change your password every 60 days. , Once you are registered with Grants.gov, you can search the website for potential historical-preservation grants.The website allows you to search by keywords such as ""historic preservation"" and ""building."" This search should return open grants that can be used for the rehabilitation of historic buildings.   Once you have identified a list of possible grants, you can review the specific application requirements of each to see whether you are eligible. Typically the first page of each grant description provides you with an overview of the grant and a specification of who is eligible to apply. If you meet the eligibility requirements, and the grant provides funding for the type of rehabilitation you're proposing, finish applying for the grant.   , The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) funds a grant for public agencies or private, nonprofit organizations called the Challenge Grant. These grants are used to help organizations or agencies secure long-term funding for humanities programs and resources. While the grant is not specifically for historic preservation, under special circumstances the grant may be used to support construction and renovation projects.Challenge Grant eligibility and program requirements change, so it is important for you to review the requirements regularly to see whether your organization would qualify for funding. You can review the eligibility requirements on the NEH website by searching for “Challenge Grants.” , The NPS provides matching grants to states for the protection of historic properties. Some states work with nonprofit organizations or agencies to rehabilitate historic-preservation sites. If you are interested in applying for a National Park Service grant, you should contact your SHPO and see whether it works with organizations like yours on rehabilitation projects.   You should also search for NPS grants on the Grants.gov website and see whether your project meets the eligibility requirements for grants. You can find a list of State Historic Preservation Offices on the National Park Service website., The NTPF allows members who are public agencies or nonprofit organizations to apply for NTPF grants that can be used for limited historic-preservation projects. All applicants must match NTPF grant funds dollar-for-dollar, and the funds cannot be used for construction. They can be used to hire a preservation architect, a landscape architect, a preservation planner, or a real estate development consultant.

Common benefits include Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, and other benefits. If they do, then you’ll need to create an estate plan that doesn’t cause your heir to lose those benefit.   Fortunately, you can create a “third-party settled special needs trust.” You fund this trust with cash or assets. Because the assets aren’t owned in your heir’s name, the government won’t consider them when determining your heir’s eligibility for government benefits.If you leave money directly in a will, then you may disqualify the heir. For this reason, you should proceed cautiously and create an appropriate trust.; , Your heir can also fund their own trust, called a “self-settled special needs trust.”You should investigate what kinds of assets they already have available.   For example, a disabled person might have won a sum of money in a lawsuit. Alternately, another family member might have left them assets. If they set up a proper trust with their assets, they can still qualify for government benefits. However, government benefits may have to be repaid with assets left over in the trust after their death., Most people have most of their wealth in retirement accounts. You should have named beneficiaries to receive your benefits after your death. Check whether you named the disabled heir as a beneficiary.   If you named your disabled heir, then the government will count those assets when determining if your heir is eligible for government benefits.You can avoid this problem by naming the special needs trust as the beneficiary. However, leaving retirement benefits to a special needs trust has negative tax consequences. You should talk this over with a lawyer. Instead, you might want to leave retirement benefits to your other heirs and fund the special needs trust with other assets., You can also leave life insurance proceeds to a special needs trust. Ideally, you will have permanent (not term) life insurance. Permanent life insurance can provide for your disabled heir regardless of when you die.Some insurers, such as Merrill Lynch and MetLife, have create divisions to help clients plan for a disabled heir.Choose an insurer with experience helping families with special needs children and get expert help. Think carefully about who to insure. If one parent stays home to care for a disabled child and the other works, you might want to insure the caregiver so that you can afford to pay someone else to care for your child. If you already have life insurance, then review the beneficiary designations on the policy. You don’t want to leave life insurance proceeds directly to the disabled heir if they receive government benefits.  , Begin by estimating their likely life expectancy. Then calculate how much it costs each year for medical care, housing, personal attendants, etc. You should have some of this information already at hand.   Remember to deduct the amount of government benefits they will continue to receive in the future., A qualified estate planning lawyer can review your situation and provide tailored advice. You should schedule a consultation and meet to discuss the best course to take.   You can get a referral to a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association.Ask for a trust and estates attorney, preferably one who has handled planning for disabled heirs. Planning for disabled heirs has its own unique wrinkles, and you’ll want a lawyer who has extensive experience in this area.Call up the lawyer and schedule a meeting. Ask how much the lawyer charges. Talk with the lawyer about whether your disabled heir will need to be at the meeting.  , Your lawyer will want to know how you will fund the special needs trust. You probably will need to complete detailed paperwork before showing up to your consultation. You may also need to bring copies of your retirement account and life insurance policies. Ask ahead of time what you will need.  , Pooled trusts are special needs trusts. However, they are usually run by nonprofits.You won’t have to name a trustee because the nonprofit will name one. Pooled trusts are helpful if you don’t know who to name as a trustee or if you aren’t leaving much money.   Pooled trusts aren’t available everywhere. Talk to your lawyer about whether this is an option and where you can find more information.  , You will transfer assets to the trust, which means they are no longer yours. Your disabled heir will be the “beneficiary” of the trust. You’ll also need to name someone as the “trustee,” who oversees the trust. The trustee invests the assets and disburses money for the beneficiary’s benefit.Talk with your lawyer about who would be a good trustee. Generally, you will want to name someone who is familiar with your disabled heir’s needs.For example, a sibling might be a good choice. A trustee should also be financially responsible, although they do not need to be a financial expert. You can name successor trustees in case your first choice declines, dies, or chooses to stop acting as trustee.  , If you left assets directly to a disabled heir in your will, you may need to revise it. You don’t want these assets to pass to them in probate after you die, since the assets may disqualify the person for government benefits.   Show your lawyer a copy of your current will. You may need to draft an amendment or revoke the old will and draft an entirely new one.  , Since you’re meeting with the lawyer about the special needs trust, you should tackle related issues at the same time. For example, talk about the following with your lawyer:   Your own death or incapacity. For example, you might want to create a durable medical power of attorney in case you become incapacitated. You can also create a durable financial power of attorney so that someone can manage your finances when you no longer can.How you will provide for your other heirs. For example, you might want to create a will at the same time you create the special needs trust. Alternately, you could create a separate trust for your other heirs. Whether you should write a nonbinding statement of wishes. Immediately after you die, it will take a little bit of time for a special needs trust to go into effect. During this period, you’ll want to provide for your disabled heir. Your letter can explain who should take care of the heir until a guardian can be named, as well as what medications they should take and where they should stay., If your child is a minor, you can name a guardian. This person will take care of your child once you die. Check your will to see if you have named someone. If not, your lawyer can help you.  , Once a child reaches adulthood, they generally are allowed to take care of themselves unless a court appoints a guardian to make decisions for them. Discuss with your lawyer about being named your disabled child’s guardian.   Also talk about what will happen when you die. Identify how you will provide for a successor guardian of an adult disabled child. You may have to update your will or take some other step as allowed by state law.If you name a successor guardian, be sure to talk to them ahead of time. It is a heavy responsibility for someone, and you only want to name someone who is serious about serving. You will also need to begin talking about the care your disabled child receives.  , You should set up a filing cabinet or a folder and collect important information. Remember that a future guardian is not as intimately familiar with your disabled child’s needs as you are. Put the following in the folder:Personal information. Include birth certificates, insurance policies, and social security cards. Emergency contacts. Include the name and information for the person who will care for your child immediately after your death or incapacity. If your child is in school, add the name of any guidance counselors. Medical history information. Include the name of your child’s primary physician and specialists. Also include information on medications, allergies, family medical history, insurance company policy numbers, and Medicaid information. Legal information. Include the name and contact information for your lawyer and the trustee. Financial information. Keep a copy of your estate plan and information on your child’s representative payee accounts. If you use online banking, then include account information and passwords. Your statement or letter of intent. Your personal information. Since you are creating a folder for a disabled child, you might as well create one for yourself at the same time in case you become incapacitated. Include your personal information (birth certificate, marriage certificate etc.) and financial information.

30," See your doctor., Consent to an ultrasound., Consent to laparoscopic surgery., Take all medications as directed., Notify your sexual partners.",How to Recognize Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)2," As soon as you suspect PID, make an appointment to talk with your OBGYN. They will ask you about your medical and sexual history and then will do a general pelvic exam. If they find that you are tender in your abdomen and around your cervix, then they will likely order additional testing. If your OBGYN is booked up, try contacting your primary care physician. You could also go to a clinic, such as Planned Parenthood.They may order a blood test to see if your cells appear to be fighting off an infection. They may also send off a cervical fluid sample to be tested for STDs.There is no one clear way to diagnose PID. That means that, unfortunately, it is often misdiagnosed as another problem with similar symptoms, such as appendicitis. Your doctor may also recommend hospitalization as part of your treatment if you: are very ill, won’t respond to antibiotics, have an abscess, or are pregnant.  , If your doctor believes that a PID diagnosis is possible, but needs more evidence they may request permission to complete an ultrasound, or in-depth image of your body’s interior. For example, an ultrasound can show whether or not an abscess is blocking or stretching out part of your fallopian tubes, something that is not only painful but very dangerous to your overall health., This is a procedure where your doctor will make a small incision in your abdominal area and then insert a small, lighted camera. This will allow them to view your internal organs up close and personal. They can also take tissue samples, if needed, to conduct additional testing.Even though it is only minimally invasive, a laparoscopic procedure is still surgery. So, you’ll want to be very clear on the possible risks and benefits before agreeing to go forward.  , The most common treatment for PID is antibiotics. Because PID infections are usually quite severe and may involve a number of different harmful organisms, you’ll probably have to take at least two different types of antibiotics at once. They will come in either pill form or an in-office shot.If you get pills, make sure to read the directions carefully and finish the entire run of the drugs, even if you start to feel better before they are finished. Most doctors will want you to make a follow-up appointment about three days in so they can check your progress.  , While PID is not contagious, the STDs that it often develops from, chlamydia and gonorrhea, are easily passed between sexual partners. This makes it possible for you to be cured of PID only to be infected once more. Once you’ve been diagnosed with PID, talk with your sexual partner(s) and suggest that they seek out treatment. Remember that they may show no symptoms, but still have PID and be capable of spreading it.","1. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) requires prompt medical attention, including a consultation with an OBGYN or primary care physician.
2. PID may be misdiagnosed as other conditions with similar symptoms, such as appendicitis.
3. Additional testing may include blood tests, cervical fluid samples, ultrasounds, and laparoscopic procedures to confirm a PID diagnosis.
4. Treatment for PID typically involves antibiotics, which may need to be taken for an extended period.

33," Seek out positive, supportive relationships., Set personal boundaries., Speak up for yourself when you are scapegoated., Get distance from toxic people.",How to Stop Being an Easy Target/Scapegoat3," You can counteract the negative impact of being a scapegoat by cultivating healthy relationships. Plus, when you spend time around people who treat you fairly, you will stop accepting anything less.Identify the relationships in your life in which you feel valued, encouraged, and supported. Make an effort to enrich these relationships by showing appreciation for these people and dedicating more of your time to them. Make new friendships through support groups, professional organizations, or interest groups in your community. Lean towards people who appear emotionally healthy and don’t blame you for their problems.  , Boundaries are the limitations where one person ends and another begins. In scapegoating relationships, these lines are all blurred. Stop allowing yourself to be scapegoated by setting firm boundaries.For instance, you might say to your business partner, “I will no longer tolerate being treated this way. If you want to continue having me as a partner, you will need to stop blaming me for the business failing.”  , When your boundaries are violated and others try to put you back in the scapegoat role, speak out. Show them that you are unwilling to be the scapegoat by reasserting your boundaries.You might say to your scapegoating sibling, “No, I will not pay for your court fees. I told you that I will not be held responsible for your financial troubles.”  , If others refuses to respect your boundaries, you may have to make the tough choice to cut ties. Decide whether it is best to minimize contact or cut contact completely with the offenders.Estrangement is a painful reality, but it may be necessary to help yourself get unstuck from the role of scapegoat. If the scapegoating happens in your family, you might cut ties. If it’s happening at your job, you might try to switch departments or transfer to a new employer. Work with your therapist to decide the best route for handling family members, partners or close friends who insist on blaming you.

34," Decide on a game., Learn the script., Learn how to use the above commands., Start scripting your game., Work on the instructions page., Work on the contents of the game itself., Create a winning screen., Your game should now look like the code above:   Run the program and make sure it works.  , Touch up your file., Correct grammar where appropriate., Create graphics for the game if you would like., Correct any typing errors that you can find., Congratulations, you have just created a basic computer game with batch script!  ",How to Build a Simple Computer Game Using Batch Script," Before deciding to make a shoot-em-up game or point-and-click game, know that even with MS DOS 8, batch script has serious limitations to its capabilities. You will not be able to create more of a game than a text-based game. It can be a quiz or a scenario game, but you will have only text. As to whether or not you want to have ASCII graphics is up to you, but the game will still be based entirely on text input.; , The script is not that hard to learn, you may even learn it simply by looking at a program. To know any scripting language you may need to know some basic commands in your computer's command line. For this command line, the basic commands that you will need are:   echo color title goto if set labeling (not a command, but how to label)  ,   The echo command is used to print out text to the console. Below, the echo command prints out ""Hello, world!"":       The color command is used to change the color of the text in the command line. This isn't very useful, and probably shouldn't be focused on until you have finished the game itself, but the results of the color change can be quite appealing. Colors in DOS command lines are numbered, there is a table of the colors at the end of this article. The following command will change the text color to black background with green text:       The title command simply changes the name of the window on the title bar and task bar, and is by no means useful, however, it can make your program look professional. Using it like so will change the title of the window to ""Fun Program"":       The goto command is used to go to a certain part of the program. You will be using it to determine what will happen when certain answers are chosen from questions. To use the goto command to go to a label called ""WRONG"":       The if command is used to determine what will happen if a certain event occurs. After the if statement (if ), a command follows. At the if statement, if a certain event is true, the command in the statement will be carried out. You will be using this statement to determine which goto command is to be used. This if statement will be true if the input is equal to 12:       The set command is actually quite complicated, since it may be used in many ways. As for now, all you need it for is to get the computer to receive input. To do this:       Finally, labeling. Labeling can name certain parts of the program so that you may use the goto command. You can name certain sections of the program anything, so long as the name isn't a command. To label a section ""main"", type the following:    :MAIN      Labeled sections include the label itself and all code that follow it until another label is present or the file reaches the end! Make sure you place the label before the section being labeled, and another label following it so that the computer understands what section is labeled! Example below:    @echo off :LABEL1 echo THIS IS A TEST OF TEXT set/p input=THIS IS A TEST INPUT_ if %input%==1 goto LABEL1 goto LABEL2 :LABEL2 echo TEST      The first line of the above program may have been confusing to you. This line turns off the display of the code inside the file, so it doesn't look like it was all typed out on a console. As of now that is unimportant, right now you should be determining what the above program will do(ignore the first line). The program will display text saying ""THIS IS A TEST OF TEXT"", then it will prompt for input. If the input is ""1""(meaning you typed in 1), the program will return to LABEL1 and the commands below it will repeat. If the condition in the if statement is not met, the computer will print text to the console ""TEST"". Copy the above program into two different windows running notepad. In one, save it as TEST1 in any folder and run it. Notice how the text is displayed. In the second window, erase the first line and save it as TEST2 and run it. Notice the difference?   Once you have a general understanding of how the above commands may be used, you may move on to the next step.  , It is suggested that a beginner use notepad, but if you would like to use MS DOS EDIT, that's fine, too. It is also suggested to a beginner to begin with a basic quiz game, so this is what this article will show you how to do. Remember to start by turning off the echo. Then introduce your game with some text through the echo command, then use set to allow input with the goto command. This may sound confusing, so look above (Note: the command REM creates comments, i.e. notes for the developer that won't show in the final result):  , At this point, you should save your file(save as something.bat), and put it in a folder that you created for the game. After saving it, run it and make sure it works.   From this point on you will be having multiple files per game (especially if you want to have ASCII graphics). You can get the batch script to print out the contents of any file on the screen with the type command. The below will print the contents of TEST.txt:       It's important to remember to include the file extension, or the command may not work properly.   Create an instructions page in notepad. It should say something like:       Save this as INST.txt in the folder of the batch file, then make it so that your game will print the text to the console on the instructions page:       Run the program and make sure it works.        , This is where most of your creativity/research, work, and time is spent working on the game, as well as where most of the game's scripting should be. There should be a place that you go when you get an answer wrong, and a way to advance to the next question when you get the answer right. The above will have basic questions about the exterior of a car. You may replace them with what you like.   Run the program and make sure it works.  , Creating a winning screen is as simple as the instructions screen. Create a text document with praise for winning and save it as WIN.txt in the batch folder. Add the following lines to the end of your game for the winning screen:  ,, Start by going to each label and placing the cls command after it. This will clear the screen at each label so you don't have a screen full of unnecessary information.  , If you want, make all of the answers on the list complete sentences. NOTE THAT YOU SHOULD AVOID CONTRACTIONS IN THE BATCH SCRIPT ECHO COMMAND! You should also avoid slashes and greater than/less than symbols, stars, percent symbols, and any other unusual symbols. These symbols will create a syntax error that causes the program to stop, lag, or crash.  , Generate ASCII art in separate text documents and use the type command to display them in the program:  , Think of your own things to correct. Then add your color with the color command. It is suggested that you place it at the beginning of the program so that the whole program is of this color. Here is the explanation of how to use it directly from the command line:  Sets the default console foreground and background colors.  COLOR attr Specifies color attribute of console output  Color attributes are specified by TWO hex digits -- the first corresponds to the background; the second the foreground.

35," Minimize your exposure to dust and dust mites.Dust and dust mites are common indoor allergens, so when winter comes (and you spend more time indoors) these allergy symptoms may worsen., Get rid of any mold around your home.Another common allergen that can worsen during the wintertime (due to its presence indoors) is mold., Practice good hygiene with your pet.Both pets and people may spend more time indoors during the winter, so if you are allergic to dogs or cats you may find that your allergy symptoms worsen during the colder months., Plan for the holidays.As the holidays approach, there are some additional steps you can take to handle your allergies and prevent them from getting out of control., Know that a runny nose from being outdoors is not an allergy.",How to Handle Winter Allergies1," The best way to combat the allergy symptoms is to prevent (or minimize) your exposure to the allergen in the first place. Strategies to reduce the dust and dust mites in your home include:   Purchase a HEPA air filter. This can help to clear dust out of the air, and hence reduce your allergy symptoms. Wash your bedding at least once a week in hot water. This can help to prevent the accumulation of dust and dust mites. Also use allergy-proof covers on your mattress and pillow covers to reduce the accumulation of dust and dust mites. Vacuum any carpets in the home at least twice a week, and clean any surfaces that gather dust regularly. Use a wet paper towel or sponge to clean these surfaces — a duster will just cause the dust to recirculate and settle again.; , Mold grows in damp places, such as around leaks in roofs or pipes, in the shower or bathroom, or anywhere with moisture. Strategies to reduce your exposure to mold include:   Throw out any shower curtains, carpets, or other things in your home that have mold on them. If you spot mold on something, your best bet is just to get rid of it. The longer it lingers in your home, the more of a chance there is for mold spores to get into the air and to worsen your allergy symptoms. Use a dehumidifier to reduce the humidity in your home to less than 50%. Because mold thrives with greater moisture and humidity, this can help to prevent mold problems from developing in your home.  , If you have severe pet allergies, consider getting a non-hairy pet instead such as a fish or lizard. If you only have mild pet allergies and are seeking to manage them as best as possible, you can try:   Washing your pet at least once a week. This is because, contrary to popular belief, pet hair is not the most common allergen; rather, it is pet dander (dead skin cells that naturally shed from your pet). For this reason, bathing your pet can help to diminish the dander and reduce your allergy symptoms. Keeping your pet out of the bedroom. Because you spend quite a bit of time in the bedroom every night, as well as the fact that bedrooms are often carpeted, keeping your pet out can prevent pet dander from accumulating in your bedroom. This, in turn, can help to alleviate your allergy symptoms.  , These include:   Getting an artificial Christmas tree because real trees have the potential to grow mold. Some people are also allergic to the fragrance of a real tree. If you do get a real tree, consider washing it thoroughly with water outdoors before you bring it in and decorate it. If you are visiting relatives for the holidays who have a pet (and you are allergic), plan appropriately by asking for a room as far away as possible from the pet, and by bringing allergy medications as needed. Be aware of the rebound effect if you are not spending the holidays with your own pet. Some people, after being away from their pet for several days, return home only to find that their allergy to their own pet has worsened. This is due to a decreased tolerance in your immune system following your absence. Understand that stress can trigger allergy symptoms such as hives or asthma. Try to stay as relaxed as possible over the holidays, and take steps to lighten your workload during the holidays (such as preparing some of the dishes for big dinners in advance).  , Some people confuse the runny nose they get from being outside in the cold with a winter allergy when, in fact, the two are not related. A runny nose in the cold is a vasomotor (physiological) response; it may be correlated to changes in temperature (particularly the cold), windy weather, changes in humidity, and strong odors or smoke.

Ask yourself: what's the worst thing that could happen? Is this realistic? How bad is it likely to get? Is it possible that your thinking is distorted?

When choosing tulle or organza, go for a very soft, pale color, or white. When choosing cellophane, go for something iridescent, as it will reflect the light better. You can also use teddy bear stuffing and pieces of moss instead.  , Purchase a small fairy figurine, and glue her to the inside of the jar lid using hot glue or super glue. Screw the lid back onto the jar, and turn the jar upside down. The lid will now be the bottom of the jar, making it a sort of snow globe.   Consider gluing gown bits of moss, stones, and tiny flowers to the lid around the fairy. This will hide the bottom of the lid, and give the fairy a pretty home to live in. If you cannot find a fairy figurine, you can make your own by purchasing a person-shaped figurine, and gluing craft butterfly wings to the back.  , You can make your fairy jar more colorful by painting the lid. Lightly buff the lid with fine-grit sandpaper, and wipe it clean with a damp cloth to get rid of any dust. Paint the lid with some acrylic paint using a paintbrush or a foam brush. You can also use spray paint instead.   If you are using spray paint, shake the can for a few moments until you can hear it rattle. Hold the can 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the surface and apply the paint in a light, even layer. Wait until the paint dries before applying a second layer. Make sure to spray paint in a well-ventilated area to avoid any light-headedness.  , For a more sparkly lid, brush on a layer of glue onto the top of the lid. Don't paint the sides with glue just yet. Pour some glitter onto the lid. Gently lift the lid off your work surface and tap the glitter off. Wait for the glue and glitter to dry before applying glue and glitter to the sides.   Consider working over a sheet of paper. When you are done, fold the paper in half, and use it to funnel the excess glitter back into its container. Consider sealing the glitter so that it doesn't shed. Wait for the glue and glitter to dry, then apply a thin, even coat of clear, glossy spray paint. Wait for the coat to dry completely before applying a second one.  , Place the lid on top of some pretty fabric. Trace a circle around the lid—make the circle about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) larger than the lid. Cut the circle out of the fabric and screw the lid onto the jar. Place the fabric circle on top of the lid and push the edges down around the sides of the lid. Wrap a piece of ribbon or twine around the neck of the jar, holding the fabric in place. Tie the ribbon or twine into a pretty bow.  , Take a few colorful gemstones or rhinestones, and glue them onto the lid using hot glue or tacky glue. You can also glue beads, buttons, pretty rocks, or even a figurine to the top of the jar.  , You can also decorate the ribbon by gluing a flower or rhinestone in the middle of the bow.  , Tinted mason jars come in different colors, including blue, green, and purple. They can help lend a more unique look to your fairy jar. If you cannot find a tinted mason jar, you can make your own by mixing a few drops of food coloring with a glossy decoupage glue. Paint the outside of the jar with the mixture using a paintbrush or a foam brush.   You can also paint the jar with a matte decoupage glue or matte spray-on sealer. This will give the glass a frosted look, and will work best with the battery-operated string lights.  , You can print out silhouettes of fairies and cut them out using a craft knife.

Chances are your parents think that you should be responsible for keeping your room clean on your own. So offer to go above and beyond and clean other rooms in the house. Discuss with your parents about how much each room or chore may pay you. Maybe cleaning the hallway doesn’t pay as much as the dining room, since the hallway is much smaller and takes less time.  , Doing seasonal, outside housework is another great way to earn an allowance since it’s work your parents may not have time, or want to do themselves.   Offer to rake leaves, shovel snow, mow the lawn, and weed gardens.

45," Choose your budget., Determine the type and size that you want., Check out the prices online., Commit to a bike., Know something about the sport., Negotiate., Talk the owner down on the prospective bike., Make an offer., At some point you either say, ""I like this deal"" or ""the bike looked better in pictures""., Pay the seller cash and pat yourself on the back because you have just bought your very first dirt bike!  , Finished.  ",How to Buy Your First Dirtbike," This is not a cheap hobby, but don’t be too extravagant with your budget when looking for a bike. In the $300-$600 price range, you can expect to get a bike you need to put a little money and work into. If you spend less than that, you will be harnessed a bike that needs a lot of work, effort, and money. Also, don't spend you entire budget on the bike, as there will always be unexpected costs.; , The type of bike you get is totally up to you. 2-stroke, 4-stroke, big, or small. If you're not sure, just search the web!  , Finding the right deal is the heart of buying a bike, and oftentimes bikes on places like Craigslist are overpriced. Compare bike prices using eBay; If you find a bike you like, look at past auctions to see the going price.  , If you decide to buy one through Craigslist, it will be easy to get more information about the bike without committing too much information to the seller. Make sure to always contact the seller in the way they ask so you don’t tick them off.  , The more you know about different bikes, how they work, and the motor sport world, the more details you will have to talk about with the seller. When you know what you are talking about, you can find ways to lower the sellers asking price.  , Negotiations start with the first contact. If you are too eager, the seller will get anxious and likely keep his price high because you make him feel like it’s worth more than it is. You can never be too calm about a deal. The more calm and confident you are the better results you will have. However, don't be cocky, it will turn your seller off and tell him you know nothing about what you are talking about.  , If the headlight doesn't work, bring it up. Tell him that it's not exactly what you are looking for and that you don't know if you should take it home or not. Don't go too far though, nothing is worse than a seller that comes to look at your bike and all he does is talk bad about it.  , Give him your bottom line and he might come closer to it than you think. If he doesn't seem to like it, don’t give in to his game. He simply wants to get the most money for his bike. If you act like you don’t care if you get this bike or not, you will have better chances at coming away with a good deal.  , Hopefully, the latter will convince the seller to drop his price further. Don’t be afraid to walk about. But know that there is a limited amount of resources posted on Craigslist, when you find a good or average deal don’t be afraid to commit.  ,,","- Importance of budget management when buying a bike

46," Find some friends., Talk to school administrators., Find a teacher as a sponsor., Find a meeting room., Publicize your club., Have your first meeting., Create your club’s structure., Plan projects.",How to Create an Environmental Club1," You won’t be able to do this alone, so you’ll need some people to help. Find a friend or two who cares about the environment like you do. This way, you can show others that people are already interested in your club, and you have members to help do the organizing to get things going.When you talk to other people about your club, listen to their ideas and concerns too. You might be able to fit into your potential club, making it more attractive for them to join.; , Any club that wants to draw in students and use school facilities needs to have permission from your principal or other school leader. They will tell you all the things you need to do to become an official school club, probably some paperwork. Along with this permission, they can also provide additional advice for good ways to start your club and get the word out., Most school clubs need an advisor from the faculty to help become official. Your faculty advisor will supervise your meetings, offer regular advice, and may even pitch in to help if needed. Your advisor doesn’t need to be an environmentalist, though someone who shares your concern for the environment would be a good place to start. Science teachers are probably the most likely to help, but anyone can be interested in helping the environment., When you start planning your first meeting, remember that you will need a classroom to hold it in. Make sure it is a room you can get to regularly. You will use it for scheduled meetings to discuss upcoming projects.The classroom of your advisor is probably your best bet, but check first. Someone else might be using it at different times, which will limit when you can schedule your meeting.  , Now that you have a club, make sure people know about it. There are a variety of ways to spread the word about a school club. For all of them, remember to include the name of your club, and the time and place of your first meeting. You can include other information if you want, but it needs at least that much. If people don’t know about your club and your meetings, they won’t know to attend.   Post fliers around the school. Your school probably has lots of posters for different clubs and activities. Look for ways to help yours stand out and get people’s attention. You might try printing on recycled paper, green color paper, or posters with pictures of celebrities who care about environmental causes.If your school has rules about posters and fliers, make sure you know what they are, and that you follow all instructions. If your school does announcements in the morning, over a loudspeaker or a television, make sure your club gets a mention. Talk to the person who controls the announcements, usually the principal or a teacher, about how to make sure your message gets read to the school. A good way to get people’s attention is to give a presentation in front of them. You probably won’t get the whole school, so talk to your principal or teacher about giving an announcement in your homeroom or other classes. This will give students a chance to see you directly, rather than having your club announced with a bunch of other things in the morning. Another good way to spread the word is to have your members talk to a new potential member about the club and try to encourage them to come to the next meeting. You won’t get all of these people, but even a few new arrivals can help your club grow., Once you have some people interested, and a place to meet, have your first meeting. Get people to show up and talk about what the club will be doing. Talk about what you want the club to accomplish, and how everyone will be involvedThe most important thing you can do at this meeting, along with making sure people know about your club, is to get contact information. If someone shows up, make sure you get people’s names, phone numbers, and emails. This way, you’ll be able to keep in contact with them when trying to schedule future meetings. Be sure to also give them some contact information for the club, so they can contact you if they need something. One good way to encourage people to show up to the first meeting is to provide snacks. If you are going to have food, make sure you mention it when you tell people about the meeting, so it will encourage them to come. During your first meeting, make sure you schedule and announce your next meeting. Regular meetings will help people build time in their schedule and make sure to attend, which is important for a new club.  , Once you have some people gathered, you’ll need to figure out how your club should be structured and run. It shouldn’t just be one person doing all the work and deciding what happens. Instead, create some rules for how the club decides what to do, and choose some officers.If you can, try to give your club a statement of purpose, a couple of sentences that explains who you are and what you are trying to do. This is important to help explain to people what your club believes in, and why they would want to join up. Your first meeting might be a good time to decide the kind of officers you want your club to have rather than picking him right away. Some positions to consider include a president, project coordinator, secretary, treasurer, and public relations coordinator. Make sure your club is clear about what holding these positions will entail, so you can find the right people for them.  , Once your club has started, you’ll want to start doing projects to carry out your environmental goals. The list of potential projects is endless, but to start with you should probably focus on doing something around the school.This will help spread the word about your club and get more students interested. Once you get a larger club, you’ll be able to take on even bigger projects.   You should probably have one or two ideas when you start the club. That way you can get started on something quickly, which will keep your new members interested. Once those are done, you can start taking ideas and suggestions from other club members, which should give you a nice long list of things to do. Part of planning projects may include raising money to pay for those projects. When you start your club, your school may have a budget that you can use. That may not be enough, though, so when you start planning projects think about how much money you will need to do things and how you can raise that money.","- Need people to help organize and run the club

Green primer is lightweight and more sheer than most concealers. It will be less likely to look caked on. However, with very bright, obvious pimples it's best to go with concealer as it's stronger., Many people are insecure about their concealer looking caked on. Seek out a lightweight, low oil green concealer to prevent this. You can also moisturize your skin before applying concealer to avoid a sloppy, caked on look., Get a make-up sponge from your local drug store. Concealer looks best when it's gently dabbed on with a sponge rather than spread with your fingers. Not only does concealer look messier when spread on, your fingers may contain bacteria than can worsen symptoms of acne. Only use your fingers when initially dotting the concealer on your face.        , Green concealer works primarily because of how green interacts with the color red. If your pimples are not particularly bright red, you may be better off choosing a yellow concealer to cover them., Before applying concealer, wash and moisturize your face. This can help your make-up look smoother and prevent spreading bacteria that can worsen acne symptoms.          Wash your hands first. Lather your hands with soap and wash for about 20 seconds. You can hum the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice to keep track of time. Then, rinse your hands off with clear running water.If you're worried about acne, try using an antibacterial soap designed to treat symptoms of acne.Use a moisturizer that works for your skin. Choose one that's oil free to avoid worsening acne., Once you've washed your face, apply the green concealer to the problem areas. Dot the concealer on with your index finger and then gently blot it evenly into your face with a make-up sponge. You can also use green concealer on your under eyes if you have any discoloration there.        , Once you've applied your green concealer, apply your regular concealer and foundation. You can apply other make-up as you would normally. Remember, it's best to dot on concealer and then even it out by gently patting int your skin with a make-up sponge.        , Once you've applied your concealer and foundation, complete your make-up routine as you would normally.

49," Transplant the jade plant in early spring., Use a heavy clay, terra cotta or ceramic container., Make sure the container has at least one drain hole in the bottom., Find a container that is only 1 to 2 inches deeper and wider than the old container., Use a peat-based potting mix with extra coarse builder’s sand or perlite added in., Put the new potting mix into the container at a depth of 1 to 2 inches., Remove the jade plant from its old container., Disinfect a pair of sharp scissors with a household disinfectant like Lysol., Trim off any roots that are much longer than the root mass., Put the jade plant in the new container., Water the jade plant with room-temperature water until it drains from the bottom., Take special care of the jade plant for four weeks after transplanting it., Water the plant with room-temperature water when the top of the potting mix begins to dry., Do not overwater the plant., Avoid giving the plant any fertilizer while the root system is recovering., Keep the plant out of direct sunlight.",How to Transplant a Jade Plant," This is the time when they are just entering a season of vigorous growth.They recover from the stress of being repotted more easily and quickly during this season.; , This will help to keep the plant upright.Jade plants tend to become top heavy and fall over easily.  , This will allow excess water to drain from the pot.   If the excess water cannot drain away, it will keep the potting soil too moist and restrict air movement which can cause root rot and kill the plant.  , Larger containers will encourage excessive root growth or hold too much soil around the roots which will keep them wet for too long., This will allow the soil to drain more quickly.You can mix the perlite or sand into the potting mix at a ratio of two-thirds potting mix and one-third perlite or sand.  , The top of the jade plant root mass should be about 1 inch below the top of the container after it is transplanted.  , Do this by laying the pot on its side, grasping the base of the stem in your hand and sliding the roots out., Soak them in the disinfectant for five minutes, rinse them in tap water and dry them off with a clean towel.   This will kill fungal spores and bacteria that may infect the jade plant.  , Then, cut the roots off so they are even with the rest of the root mass.   Trimming off these long roots will cause the plant to develop a healthier root system within the root mass.  , Then, fill in the spaces around the roots with potting mix.  , This will settle the soil around the roots and give the plant some moisture.   If there is a saucer beneath the container to catch the water that drains from the hole, empty it after watering the plant. Water left in the saucer could leach back up into the potting mix and keep the roots too wet.  , The jade plant will be stressed from being transplanted and should be cared for a little differently while it recovers.  , The jade plant needs to be watered more often than usual because the root system has been compromised and cannot absorb water efficiently.Room-temperature water will not shock the roots like cold tap water. If the jade plant is not getting enough water, its succulent leaves will begin to shrivel and may develop brown spots., Too much water will cause the leaves to turn yellow.  , The jade plant does not need fertilizer during this time and it could burn the roots.  , As the leaves are not receiving moisture as efficiently as usual, they could be burned by too much sunlight.  ","1. Jade plants need to be transplanted during a season of vigorous growth to recover from stress.

You should have five cork discs.  , Once you are done, you should have a total of 15 cork discs.  , This will create the fractal design of your coaster., Once you are happy with the shape, place a bit of hot glue on the sides of the cork discs to glue them together.Set this pentagon aside and allow it to dry.  , Use five more cork discs to create another pentagon shape.  , Apply glue to each piece of cork and reform your pentagon. Try to be sure that your pentagons are matched as close to possible, the way a real fractal would appear in nature.  , Using the last pieces of cork, glue together the final fractal just as you did the previous two. Again, try to get each of the fractals to match in shape as close to possible.  , Place glue on one of the sides of the cork fractal and adhere it directly to the side of another.  , This last piece will come into contact with both of the other cork fractals, so you need to be sure to apply glue to two adjacent sides.Once you have applied the glue, slide the final fractal into the other two so that it roughly forms a triangular shape.  , Both sides may look identical, or not. The side you want to be displayed once the coaster is complete is up to you.  , After you have decided which side of the coaster you would like to be displayed (or up), go ahead and lay it down on a flat surface display side down.  , Not just each cork fractal, but each individual disc. You will need to work rather quickly so that the glue does not begin to dry before you are finished applying it to each disc.  , You should do this before the glue dries to make sure that the cork pieces properly adhere. Once you have the felt in position, use your palms to apply a gently amount of pressure to the felt. This will make sure the glue fills any gaps between the felt and the uneven surfaces of cork.   The felt will help maintain the form of the coaster., Once the hot glue has dried you can trim the excess felt.

51," Find a team., Learn how to aim with a Barricade., Battle on the front lines., Decide which type of dart to use., Keep extra ammunition handy., Use the Barricade's disadvantages to your advantage.",How to Win a Nerf War With a Barricade," Try to make it so that your team has at least 2 people. If you have a team, your teammate(s) have more guns, so you won't have to completely rely on your Barricade, because your teammate(s) will also be shooting. Also, with a teammate, you can use your teammate's guns instead of your Barricade.; , The Barricade shoots differently than other Nerf guns, and you will need to know how to aim it if you are going to use it in battle. Aim down the sights slightly higher than you want to shoot, increasing the height the farther you are from your target. Also, put the wind-speed into account. Because of the fact that Nerf darts are foam, the wind will easily blow them off-target. If the wind is blowing from the right, aim the gun slightly to the left, and vice versa.   Also, put the recoil of the Barricade into account. The Barricade is a semi-automatic weapon, and it will have recoil when you shoot it one shot after the other. One way to reduce the recoil would be to hold your breath when you are shooting it. Another way is to hold it with two hands when you are shooting it. Another way to reduce the recoil is to shoot slowly. When you shoot one shot after the other, there will be a whole lot of recoil. If you shoot slowly, there won't be as much. Do all three of those things to reduce the recoil, and you will be aiming like a professional.  , A Barricade was designed to be used while running, because of it's ability to be shot quickly and being lightweight. The Barricade is also very loud, and should not be used for stealth, although it can be modified. The Barricade is also quite small, so run around with it, and you are guaranteed success.  , If you want the darts to stick to walls, and your enemy, then use the suction darts. If you want the dart to make a sound when it is shot, and you want to get the attention of the enemy so that they stop attacking a teammate, then use the whistler darts. You can also use a mix of suction darts and whistler darts.  , Consider using a bandolier kit. The Barricade holds only 10 darts at one time, and they easily run out because of the fact that the gun is semi-automatic, and is usually shot with speed.  , The main disadvantage about the Barricade, is that it is unnecessarily loud. In order to turn the gun on, you have to deal with the loud humming/buzzing noise. A way to use this to your advantage, is to try to get the enemies' attention on you, and away from your teammates. While you fend off your enemies, your teammates can flank your enemies, and/or go to their base and steal ammo. Another disadvantage about the Barricade is that it isn't clip-fed, so you have to put darts inside one by one. There is a couple of clever ways to use this to your advantage. One way is that you can put one or two darts inside the gun, and then surrender to an enemy that is alone. The darts will not be seen by the enemy, and he will be caught off guard. When he comes to take the gun from you, shoot his chest twice, and he will die. Another way to use this to your advantage is to sit in one area, and to shoot enemies that come by. This is called camping. You will need many darts beside you, because after every shot, you will put one dart inside the gun. You will not run out of ammunition until all of your darts run out. You can't do this with a gun that is clip-fed, though, and that is what is unique about the Barricade.   When you sit there, you should put a shoulder-stock on the gun, so that you can shoot more accurately.  ","1. Teamwork is important, especially if your teammates have more guns.
2. Aiming the Barricade requires adjusting for range, wind, and recoil.
3. The Barricade is designed for running and quick shooting.
4. Choose the right type of darts for your strategy.
5. Consider using a bandolier kit to carry more darts.
6. Use the Barricade's loudness to your advantage in distracting enemies.
7. Take advantage of the Barricade's manual loading feature for strategic purposes. 
8. Consider using a shoulder-stock on the Barricade for better accuracy."

Google the meaning and see what other people are thinking it means; you might realize that one of their ideas suits the song better than your original idea.  , Don't go too overboard; it's okay to have a few tees and a jacket, but don't stuff your wardrobe with their merchandise. If you want all their CDs, then that's a different matter; you aren't wearing their CDs, so you can own as many of them as you'd like. Try ordering anything of theirs straight from the band's website's online store; that way you don't give up most of your money to the corporate store selling the shirts.  , If there's ever a concert of theirs in your area, make sure to try to go. Bring some friends who like the same music as you do so you can have twice as fun. Take pictures and post them to social networking sites.  , Listen to other bands too. It's great to have varied tastes in music and knowledge about musicians; learn about some of your other favorite bands too.

Alternatively, use creative rainbow colors.  There are many hues of feathers on the hummingbird, so, if you feel like it, celebrate them.  Let creativity overcome realism.  ,  Sketch it large compared to the bird.,  Add green leaves for contrast.,  This can consist of more flowers painted in clear focus or slightly blurred.  To get the illusion of out of focus flowers, sketch their placement lightly in pencil and paint them on paper that you have dampened with water.  Allow the area to sit a minute for the water to soak in and then paint the flowers with any colors you wish.  ,      Remember that painting this on wet paper allows the blue to appear faded and blurry.  Consider filling in the sky area with yellow to represent a brilliantly sunny day.  ,  This choice will give the illusion that you are in the midst of a lot of flowers in a garden., Remember that hummingbirds can be aggressive and scrappy.  Many can often be seen at a feeder, but one might be protective of his food and try to attack the others.    Butterflies, ladybugs or dragonflies might also be fun to include.  ,  If you need to add further details, do so on a dry painting to preserve the colors you have already put down.,  You might not see a hummingbird everyday in the flesh, but a painting will last forever.    ","1.

59," Select the paste you will use., Restrain the calf., Immobilize the cow’s head., Use a sedative if you do not have a chute to put your cow in., Locate the horn bud., Apply 3 ml to 5ml of 2% lidocaine into the base of the horn bud., Apply a protective layer of vaseline around the base of the horn bud., Apply the caustic paste., Allow the calf to rest.",How to Dehorn a Cow2," There are many pastes out on the market. Always read the labels of these products; many of these products can be used on calves that are up to eight weeks old, and can also be used on calves immediately after birth. However, some pastes may have an age limit, so always double check.  , The first step in using a dehorning paste is to restraint the calf by placing it inside a restraining chute. A restraining chute is a metal cage composed of metal tubes. It can fit one cow or calf at a time, and has a special space in front where the cow’s head can fit. Once the head is passed through the open space, special bars or tubes can be fixed and adjusted so that the cow’s head can be firmly held in place.  , Once the cow’s head is in place, have an assistant move the cow’s head towards the assistant’s thighs. To do this, have the assistant push the cow’s muzzle with his left hand so that the cow’s muzzle rests against the assistant’s thigh. For the right horn, the assistant would use his right hand.Another way to restrain a calf is by placing it in a chute and having an assistant push the calf forward so that the head protrudes outside of the chute. Another assistant can then use his left hip to push the head of the calf against the vertical post of the chute, making the head turn at a right angle with the vertical post of the chute. The left hand is then used to support and hold the back of the head. In this way the horn buds are exposed while the animal is immobilized.  , The calf can also be restrained by administering a sedative like Xylazine. Once the calf is sedated, the calf is gently laid down in a lying position and the front and hind limbs are tied down.  , Once the calf is sedated, feel for the horn bud on the calf’s head. Gently trim away hair on and around the horn bud. Lightly brush the horn bud with a small wire brush.   Do not brush the bud too hard or else it may bleed.  , Locate the occipital groove, which runs behind the cow’s eye and into the horn. Once you find the groove, inject the lidocaine at the base of the bud.   Make sure to hold the syringe at a 45 degree angle away from the eye. Wait 10 to 20 minutes for the medication to take effect.  , Apply the vaseline with your index finger and make sure that it does not get on the horn bud.  , Using a wood applicator or a syringe, apply a thin film of dehorning paste over the entire horn bud and over a small ring of adjacent skin. Only one application of the paste is necessary.   In calves that are one week of age or younger, the entire application area may only be the size of a nickel. In calves that are older than one week, the application area may be the size of a quarter.  , Once the application has been placed on the horn buds, allow the calf to rest away from other animals and in a place protected from the elements.  ","- Dehorning paste can be used on calves up to eight weeks old

If your yard doesn't have a tree with a branch that meets these standards, consider a different project.   Oak trees are ideal, but any type of sturdy hardwood tree may be used. Evergreens and fruit trees should be avoided. Pick a healthy branch that is at least eight inches in diameter. Carefully inspect for any signs of disease or splitting. A sickly branch is more likely to break off and fall, potentially causing serious injury to anyone below. The placement of your swing should be at least three to five feet out from the tree's trunk. Press down on the branch at the point where you intend to hang your swing. If the branch bounces, choose a sturdier one. Do not pick a branch that is too high off the ground. Twenty feet should be the maximum,but if you are making a swing for a young child, consider a lower branch. Remember that the higher the swing's attachment point, the greater the height your child may fall from.; , You will need wood, rope, twine, three-inch deck screws, wood glue, fine grit sandpaper, two stainless steel quick link carabiners, and the right tools for the job.   For tools, you will need a saw, a leveler, measuring tape, a sanding block, and a cordless drill. Buy enough 1.5-inch thick pressure treated wood for the job. You will need enough for three 7.25-inch wide pieces: one measuring 36 inches in length and two that are each 4 inches long. A two-by-eight board that is four feet long will be the easiest to work with. (If you are new to woodworking, keep in mind that the actual width and thickness of a two-by-eight are 7.25 inches and 1.5 inches respectively.)You will need a rope that is twice your planned swing's height (from the branch to the seat) plus an additional 12 feet. Use twisted polypropylene rope at least 3/8 inches in diameter. Keep in mind that nylon rope is typically too slippery for a good swing and a natural-fiber rope will eventually rot. Cut the rope into four pieces: two 10-foot lengths and two that are one foot longer than your swing's height., Throw one end of each rope up over the branch. Position the two ropes so that they are slightly over three feet apart. Tie a running bowline slip knot to one end of each rope. Next, thread the free end of each rope through its corresponding knot. Tug each free end to tighten the knot onto the branch.   This type of knot is very secure but will also expand with the growing tree. If needed, you can attach one end of each rope to a rock with some twine before attempting to throw it. This extra step will make getting the ends up over the branches much easier., Remember that the base of your swing will be made up of three rectangles that will all be 7.25 inches wide. Mark two rectangles that are 4 inches for the supports and a third that is 36 inches for the main seat. Double-check your measurements before you begin sawing., To avoid the potential problem of the swing's seat cutting into the rider's thigh, sand down the front and rear top edges of your main seat piece. These will be two of the long edges on the same face of the board.You may also choose to sand down the other edges of the seat, but this is not necessary.  , Arrange the two supports each on opposite ends of the main board. If you only sanded down the top edges, make sure the support pieces are on side opposite from where you sanded. First, secure the pieces in place with wood glue. Next, reinforce the attachment using five deck screws for each support piece. Pattern the screws so that one is near each corner with the fifth directly in the center., Place two holes on each end through both the seat and its supports. Try to make each hole the same distance from the supports' edges and the center screw. The two holes on each side should create a line parallel to the seat's short side and perpendicular to its long side. Make sure the holes are wide enough to thread your rope through but not much wider., Use one rope for the two holes on one end and the second rope on the other. The two ropes should not cross. Position the ropes so that their ends are on the same side as the support pieces.  , Tie four stopper knots, one at each end of the ropes underneath the swing seat. Do not tie the knots too tight in case you need to adjust them later. There should now be two slings, one attached to each end of the seat., Unscrew your carabiners and hook one onto each sling. Screw the locking sleeves back on tight. Next, tie the ends of each rope hanging down to the quick links using a secure knot, such as a buntline hitch., Place a leveler on the seat to check for unevenness. If your seat isn't level, adjust the stopper knots accordingly. For example, if the seat is dipping forward and to the left, pull a little more rope through the bottom and move the knot up. Once the seat is level, tighten your knots. Your swing is now ready for use.  ","1. Choosing a safe and sturdy tree branch for a swing

65," Figure out what he likes., Ask him questions., Ask for his help., Compliment him.",How to Flirt With a Shy Guy1," Start by figuring out what his interests are and then talk to him about them. Most people are comfortable talking about things they like to do.   Maybe he likes a certain band or loves videogames or movies. Or maybe it’s a sport he’s interested in. Act genuinely interested in his interests (but if his interests truly bore you and you’re completely faking it, consider that he’s not the right guy for you.) Even better yet, figure out areas of common interest that you both like and start there so that your interest is genuine. Just be yourself.; , One of the best communication techniques to get a shy person to open up is to ask them questions rather than uttering statements.   Make the questions casual, not nosy. Ask him about something he likes to do or is interested in, such as whether he saw the latest movie with his favorite actor. Asking questions draws shy people out of their shells by helping stimulate their side of the conversation. Use your intellect. Ask open-ended questions. These are questions that are phrased to elicit an explanatory, detailed response. Start the question with words like what, how, in what way, and why. Asking questions that start with words like “do” will provoke terse, single-word yes or no responses.  , Maybe it’s just conversation that unnerves the shy guy and stands outside his comfort zone.   He’s probably an observer who’s deep but has trouble expressing that to strangers or people he doesn’t know very well.  Flirt with him by asking for his help with something. A lot of guys do feel comfortable with being the person who helps out. Consider it their inner knight coming to the surface. Whether it’s help with your car, a math equation, or a stuck locker room door, ask if he can help you out. Don’t ask him for help with emotional problems, though, at this point.  , Everyone likes to be complimented. It’s human nature. A shy guy is going to be no different.So point out you like the color of his shirt. Or that you like his new jeans or his haircut or the way he thinks. Don’t just point out his physical appearance, point out an attribute about him that you like. Perhaps it’s his loyalty or how smart he is at a certain subject. Say his name a lot when talking to him, and give him a lighthearted but complimentary nickname. This will probably get him to laugh and open up.  ","1.

They don't all have to come from along your hairline. You can have them all start from the center of your head instead.  , You will need about 12 strands per cornrow. If you want thicker, more drastic cornrows, you will need 24 strands. Each strand should be a little thicker than the last one. Have your first set of strands laid out and ready to use.The extensions don't have to match your hair color. Feel free in use a bright color for a surprising effect.  , Take your first section and divide it into three smaller sections. Cross the left section over the middle one, then cross the right section over the middle one., Fold the thinnest kanekalon strand in half, and bring it around the back of your head. The looped part should be facing your hairline and the two tails should be hanging down the back of your head., The easiest way to do this would be to simply feed the middle section through the loop. The kanekalon strand should now be between your real hair and your scalp. Make sure that it is centered.  , Make sure that the center (folded) part of the kanekalon strand is tucked under the middle section of your braid. Add the left side of the strand to the left section of your braid, and the right side to the right section., Holding the left side of the kanekalon hair and the left section of your braid together, cross them over the middle section. Repeat this step for the right section.If you want a thicker cornrow, add another strand of kanekalon hair to the middle section after you cross the right section.  , This time, take a slightly-thicker strand than before. Tuck it under the middle strand, and add the left and right sides to the left and right sections of your braid., For a thinner, more natural braid, add the kanekalon after you cross both the left and right sections. For a thicker, more dramatic braid, add the kanekalon after every cross-over.Start with the thinner strands and work your way to the thicker ones. Keep your stitches nice and tight. Use more curling cream to smooth down any stray hairs, if needed.  , You can regular-braid the kanekalon hair for a few more inches/centimeters if you'd like to, but leave the bottom half of the hair unbraided for now., Hold a pair of scissors parallel to the strand with the tips pointing upward. Cut into the end of the strand to thin it out. You only need to thin the bottom few inches/centimeters. This will help your braid maintain the same thickness throughout., Do a regular braid for this. Keep the stitches nice and tight. You can braid as far down as you like, but more stylists will braid all the way down to the end of the extension.If you are not braiding all the way down, cut off the excess extensions.  , Wrap a thin hair elastic a few times around the end of the braid. Tuck the tail under the elastic, then wrap the elastic a few more times. This conceals the end without having to deal with heat-sealing., You may have noticed that there are some hairs sticking out of the folded end of your braid. This is perfectly normal. Use a small pair of scissors to trim away any stray strands., This can get tiring, especially if you are doing it by yourself. Remember to take breaks, especially if your arms start to feel sore. You can use the same color of extension for each cornrow, or you can add a few colored ones for a unique look.  , Use your fingers to apply some hydrating hair cream to the fine hairs at your hairline.

Remove from heat once it begins to simmer, before it reaches a full boil.White granulated sugar is fine, but if you’d prefer a hint of molasses, use raw cane sugar or natural brown sugar instead. If your syrup reaches a boil, it’s not the end of the world. You’ll just have to wait a few extra minutes before moving on to the next step. If, however, it's boiled so long that it has begun to reduce in volume, measure how much liquid is left and add the difference.; , After you remove your syrup from the burner, give it a few minutes to cool down a little. While it sits, pour 2 cups (200 g) of cranberries into a medium glass bowl. Once the water has cooled off a little, pour it into the bowl. Seal the bowl with a lid, foil, or plastic wrap. Then place it in the refrigerator to chill overnight.You want to let the water cool off before pouring to avoid bursting the cranberries. To eliminate this risk entirely, wait until the water cools off to room temperature.  , After your berries have chilled overnight, pour them into a strainer and let any excess moisture drain. Then dry your glass bowl with a towel or paper towels. Add a spoonful of sugar, then about a small portion of your berries. Toss them with a couple spoons or by covering the bowl with its lid and shaking it to coat the berries with sugar, which will stick to the glaze.  Once they are more or less evenly coated, transfer to them to a baking sheet. Then repeat until you have coated all your berries. Working in small portions will help coat each berry more evenly. It will also prevent the sugar from clumping up due to too much moisture.  , Once you have coated all your berries, give the sugar a few hours to dry to the berries. Then give them a look-over. If there are any bare spots, or if you just prefer a sweeter treat, toss them again with more sugar.By now the glaze should be well on its way to dry, so it should only take another hour for the added sugar to dry to your berries.

69," Know what flavor to expect., Get what you pay for., Opt for whole saffron instead of ground., Store the saffron carefully., Crush and soak the threads., Toast the threads., Crumble and add directly., Use a small amount., Use saffron in grain-based recipes., Add saffron to desserts., Combine saffron with other flavors as desired., Do your research., Take saffron extract for medicinal purposes., Make your skin glow., Drink saffron milk.",How to Use Saffron," Saffron has a pungent, musty taste and scent with sweet floral accents. When used in excess, however, the taste can quickly become bitter.   Saffron has a flavor profile similar to vanilla: sweet and musky. The two typically work well together, but they are not similar enough to serve as strict substitutes for one another. Turmeric and safflower are often used instead of saffron to give foods a similar color, but the flavors are much different.; , Harvesting saffron is a labor-intensive process, so if you want high-quality saffron, prepare yourself for an expensive purchase.   Examine the saffron before you buy it. Good saffron consists of fine, evenly sized threads that are deep red in color with an orange tendril on one end and a trumpet-shaped flute on the other. If the tendril looks yellow, the saffron is likely real but of slightly poorer quality. Additionally, a stronger scent also indicates a stronger, better flavor. In comparison, fake saffron may look like shredded, irregular threads with disconnected tendrils and pieces of bark mixed into the package. The scent may not be very strong and usually smells like bark.  , Simply put, whole saffron has a stronger flavor than ground saffron. Ground saffron can be a good substitute if you cannot find or afford the whole spice, though.   If you do decide to buy ground saffron, go through a reputable spice seller. Less honest sellers may cut saffron with other spices, including turmeric and paprika, to reduce the overall cost.  , Saffron doesn't spoil, but it will gradually lose its flavor in storage. Proper storage can preserve the saffron for longer periods, however.   Wrap the saffron threads in foil and place them in an airtight container. Store them in a cool, dark place for up to 6 months. For longer storage, keep the container of saffron in your freezer for up to 2 years.Note that ground saffron should be used within 3 to 6 months and stored in an airtight container and a cool, dark place.  , The process of crushing and soaking saffron releases the maximum amount of flavor from the threads, so it's strongly recommended.   Take the saffron threads you intend to use for the recipe and crush them into a powder using a mortar and pestle. If you don't have a mortar and pestle, you can crumble the threads in between your fingers.Steep the crushed saffron in warm water, stock, milk, or white wine for 20 to 30 minutes. If there's any liquid in your recipe, use a small amount of the specified liquid from the instructions.Add the saffron and soaking liquids directly to your recipe when called for.  , Toasting is another common way to prepare saffron, and it's especially common for traditional paella recipes.   Place a cast iron skillet on the stove over medium heat. Add the saffron threads to the hot skillet. Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 or 2 minutes. They should release an even stronger aroma but should not be allowed to burn. Cool slightly and grind the toasted saffron threads using a mortar and pestle. This powder can be soaked or added directly to the recipe.  , While not ideal, you can crumble and add the threads of saffron directly to the dish while you cook it if the recipe calls for a large amount of liquid.   Note that if you use commercially ground saffron, you'll typically add it directly to the dish instead of soaking it.  , In large qualities, saffron will produce a bitter flavor. It's best to prepare and use very small amounts in your dishes.   When possible, count the threads instead of measuring them by volume. Note that a ""pinch"" of saffron equals about 20 medium threads, and a pinch is usually enough in most recipes that serve four to six people. When using powdered saffron instead of whole threads, note that 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of powder equals about 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of threads.This amount is usually enough for recipes that serve 8 to 12 people; scale it as needed based on the number of servings.  , Most traditional recipes calling for saffron are grain-based, including risotto, pilaf, and paella.   You can find a recipe that calls for saffron or add it to a basic recipe. As a general guideline, add about 30 threads of saffron to four servings of risotto or pilaf made with 12 oz (300 g) of rice. Add 50 threads of saffron to a paella recipe that serves four., Since saffron has a flavor profile similar to vanilla, it works well in many desserts that typically feature vanilla as the primary flavor.This includes custard, plain pastry, and sweet breads.   For custards, only add a pinch of saffron to the recipe per four servings. For pastry and plain cookies, use 15 to 20 threads of saffron for every 8 oz (200 g) of flour called for in the recipe. Note that butter accents the taste of saffron better than margarine. For sweet breads, adding 15 threads of saffron per 1 lb (450 g) of flour will create a subtle flavor, but you can add up to 60 threads for the same amount of flour if you'd prefer a stronger taste.  , If you want saffron to serve as the primary flavor in a dish, you'll need to avoid adding other spices, herbs, or aromatics. When mixed with other spices, however, saffron can give dishes an overall deeper flavor.   When mixing saffron into dishes flavored with other seasonings, it's best to use only a pinch. Add the saffron early on so that the flavor can blend into the other ingredients more thoroughly. Seasonings frequently paired with saffron include cinnamon, cumin, almond, onion, garlic, and vanilla. If you plan to add saffron to meat or vegetable dishes, gravitate toward those based on light meats and vegetables. For example, you could try adding it to a chicken or cauliflower dish.  , While saffron is most commonly used in cooking and baking, it can also be used for medicinal or cosmetic purposes. Research the effects of saffron thoroughly before using it for non-culinary purposes, though.   Early research suggests that saffron might be effective as an alternative treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, depression, menstrual discomfort, and premenstrual syndrome.There is little to no research to suggest that saffron is effective against asthma, infertility, psoriasis, digestive trouble, baldness, insomnia, pain, cancer, or other conditions. Avoid taking more than 12 to 20 grams of saffron since such large amounts can actually be toxic. You should also avoid medicinal saffron if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, or if you're suffering from bipolar disorder, low blood pressure, or various heart conditions.  , Under the guidance of a physician, you could take a pure, high-quality saffron extract to help treat Alzheimer's disease, depression, menstrual discomfort, or premenstrual syndrome.For Alzheimer's disease, take 30 mg per day for 22 weeks to improve symptoms. Note that this will not cure the disease, however. For depression, take 15 to 30 mg per day. Continue for six to eight weeks. Results may be as effective as a low-dose antidepressant in some individuals. For menstrual discomfort, take 500 mg of an extract containing saffron, celery seed, and anise up to three times daily for the first three days of menstruation. For premenstrual syndrome, take 15 mg of an ethanol saffron extract up to twice daily while symptoms last. The effect usually kicks in after two menstrual complete menstrual cycles.  , Topical applications of saffron are traditionally used to lighten, brighten, and clear skin. The exact application procedure will vary based on its intended purpose, though.   Use a saffron milk mask to hydrate and soften skin. Soak a pinch of saffron threads in about 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of cold milk for several minutes, then splash the mixture onto freshly cleaned skin. After it dries, wash it away with lukewarm water. To treat acne, crush 5 to 6 basil leaves with 10 to 12 threads of saffron, forming a paste. Apply the paste directly to the acne. After 10 to 15 minutes pass, wash away the paste with cool water. To soften skin over the entire body, sprinkle about 30 threads into very warm bath water. Soak yourself in the water for about 20 to 25 minutes., Aside from being a tasty beverage, saffron milk is commonly believed to help brighten your complexion when routinely enjoyed several times a week.   Boil 2 cups (500 ml) of whole milk over high heat. As soon as the milk boils, add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) sliced almonds, 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) saffron threads, 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground cardamom, and 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of honey. Simmer for 5 minutes.Enjoy the drink while it's still hot.  ","- Saffron has a pungent, musty taste and scent with sweet floral accents

71," Find humor in it., Avoid hiding your true self., Surround yourself with a support system., Find others with Tourette’s., Do volunteer work., Use your Tourette’s for artistic expression., Become knowledgeable., Attend a conference.",How to Combat Tourette's Stigma1," One way to help combat the stigma of Tourette’s is to find the humor in it. This means laughing about the unique and sometimes funny tics that accompany the syndrome.Some of the involuntary verbal tics people say are creative and humorous. Just as you would laugh at a joke someone tells, finding humor in the things you say can help you break the stigma on yourself. Acknowledge that you are funny, which is a great part of your personality.This doesn’t mean to laugh at someone because he is different or to make fun of someone. Finding humor in Tourette’s phrases acknowledges that some of the verbal tics can create funny imagery and that’s a good thing instead of laughing at someone who is different. Laughter is a great way to break down the fear or anxiety people might feel about Tourette’s. If a person is unfamiliar with how a person with Tourette’s acts, she may find the tics, verbal outbursts, and uncontrollable motions scary. By approaching your condition with humor, you can help break that fear in someone, which is the first step in acceptance and understanding.; , Because people with Tourette’s may get bullied or discriminated against, they hide their condition. Hiding the condition just reinforces the idea that something is wrong with you, when there is nothing wrong with you. You are a unique, wonderful individual who deserves to live a full life being yourself - your whole self.Don’t choose to remain at home instead of going out because you are scared. You have the same right as everyone else to enjoy what the world offers. For places where your tics may be disruptive, talk to the people who run the place. Talk to them about disability accommodations, such as private boxes or VIP seating.  , Spending time with family and friends who know about your condition and understand it can help reduce the stigma. When you go out, bring people with you. If strangers see you with your Tourette’s interacting with people, it may help them be less fearful or discriminating., It may be helpful for you to find other people who have Tourette’s Syndrome. By talking to others, learning how they deal with the condition, and making friends with people who understand you, you can start to accept yourself, remove the stigma from yourself, and learn more about your condition.Try support groups for Tourette's Syndrome. You may also be able to talk to your doctor about finding other people with Tourette's. Some practices have patients who sign privacy waivers giving their doctor permission to share information with other people who have Tourette's.Look online for Tourette's organizations or meet-ups in your area.  , Because you have Tourette’s and have unique experiences, this can make you able to understand others better. Volunteer at a local organization. This can be a Tourette’s organization, or something else, like an animal shelter, food pantry, or even a blood drive., Instead of looking at your Tourette’s as a shameful disorder, celebrate the uniqueness of the condition. Tourette’s can be a very creative condition, whether it is the words you say or the unique way you move your body. Embrace these parts of yourself.Some organizations encourage people with Tourette’s to draw pictures featuring their tics. This can be an artistic representation of an involuntary phrase you say, or a picture of your tic.Writing, playing music, or engaging in other art forms, such as painting or sculpting may also help.Other people have used their Tourette's as inspiration for dance and theater productions.If you enjoy one of these forms of expression, then you might consider developing a dance routine, monologue, or play based on your Tourette's.  , Another way to take control of your life and break the stigma of Tourette’s is to research the condition. This includes learning everything you can about Tourette’s, talking to your doctor, and being active in your treatment plan., Many foundations have conferences for people with Tourette’s or neurological conditions. Attending these conferences can help you learn more about your condition, along with meeting other people with the condition, learning how to embrace it, and learning how to live a more fulfilling life.Try searching organizations, such as the Tourette’s Association of America and Fox Foundation.

",How to Make Sushi Rice in a Rice Cooker," Sushi is made with short-grained rice because it sticks together better than long-grain rice. When you’re shopping for rice be sure to get one of the kinds that is not long-grain.Although it’s not impossible to use long-grain, it will not work as well as the shorter ones.; , Use a colander style sieve with holes that are small enough that the rice won’t fall through. Follow the instructions on the package of rice to measure out the amount you want to cook.If you use a rice cooker measuring cup, remember it is probably not a standard U.S. cup (237 ml). The package of rice and the rice cooker are likely to have different instructions for measuring the rice. Since the rice cooker is designed specifically, follow its directions over the rice package. Remember that rice expands as it cooks, so one uncooked cup of rice might be close to two cooked cups of rice.  , Grab a regular bowl, or basin of any kind, and set it under your faucet in the sink. As water strains through the rice and falls into the bowl, you’ll be able to gauge when the rice is completely rinsed.  , Turn the faucet on cold and begin to rinse the rice. This is necessary because packaged rice has lots of powdery starch in it. The rice needs to be washed completely so that it cooks up properly and doesn’t become too gooey.Cold water works best so that the rice doesn’t start cooking while you wash it. If you want to conserve water, just fill the bowl and set the sieve down into it. The rice won’t get as clean this way, but it will still rinse off most of the powder.  , Use your hands to gently massage and stir the rice so that each grain gets rinsed completely. Don’t press or squeeze the rice, as this will break the grains. As you rinse the rice, watch how the water in the bowl turns hazy from the powder.As you stir, look for any foreign objects that may have ended up in the rice. Most rice won’t have an excessive amount of non-rice, but it’s always good to check.  , When the water in the bowl is clear and not hazy, the rice is completely rinsed. Turn the water off and empty the bowl of rinse water., Set out a cookie sheet or some wax paper and pour the rice out on it. Spread it around with your hand so it forms a single layer and is not piled up. Leave the rice sitting to dry for about 15 minutes.If you are in a hurry, it’s not absolutely necessary to dry the rice, but it helps it cook better.  , Scoop the rice into a pile and begin transferring it from the drying surface into the rice cooker. Be sure you haven’t measured out more rice than your rice cooker can handle at one time. If any rice sticks to the sides, brush it down with the rest., If you used a standard U.S. measuring cup to measure the rice, rice preparation instructions typically call for an equal amount of water. If you used a cup that came with the rice cooker, follow the rice cooker directions for how much water to use.Rice cookers often have water fill lines, so if you used one rice cooker cup of rice, you’d fill to the line marked “1.” Never guess how much water the rice needs. Either follow the rice package instructions or follow the rice cooker instructions.  , Each rice cooker is different, but it is best to fill it with the rice and water before you plug it in. Otherwise it might start cooking before you are ready. If your rice cooker has multiple settings, consult the user manual. It may even have a setting for cooking sushi rice.   Be sure to set the rice cooker on a sturdy surface. Keep other objects away as heating elements always present a potential hazard.  , Close the lid on the rice cooker and leave it to cook the rice. You don’t need to stir the rice while it cooks, but pay attention to how long it needs to cook. This is determined more by the model of rice cooker you have than by anything else.   Your rice cooker may have a timer or an automatic shut-off, but if not, be sure to set a timer as directed by the rice package or the rice cooker instructions. Rice will overcook if you leave it in for too long.  , In a small bowl, combine ½ cup (118 ml) of rice vinegar (not any other kind of vinegar), two tablespoons (30 ml) of sugar, and two teaspoons (9.9 ml) of salt. Stir until the dry ingredients dissolve.These proportions are for three uncooked cups (710 ml) of rice. Adjust the proportions as needed for smaller or larger batches of rice. Seasoning comes down to preference, so you may want a stronger or weaker taste. If you don’t want to mix it yourself, look for bottled “Sushi Vinegar” at the grocery store.  , Scoop the rice out of the rice cooker into a large bowl. Pour the seasoning evenly over the rice. You may even want to add just a little of the seasoning at a time, mix it thoroughly, and taste it. Add more seasoning to your preference.  , Using a rice paddle or wide spatula, stir the rice gently so that the vinegar mixture coats every grain as evenly as possible. Mix for a few minutes to distribute it. As you mix the sushi rice, don’t smash the rice and try not to break the grains.,","- Sushi is made with short-grained rice

Keep your cuts half an inch to three quarters of an inch apart (about 1.3 to 2 centimeters).Remember, only make a few cuts if you're distressing the sides of jeans and stay away from the side seams.  , Once the cuts are made, pull away excess fabric with tweezers until the holes are covered by bare strands of thread. Pull out as many threads as you can, only working in the areas where you cut. Try to remove all the colored threads so only white elastic threads are spread across the holes.

The lower, the better. Also consider credit limit. It may be the case that a credit card with a low-interest rate also has an unacceptably low credit limit.

Decide on whether you think it's worth it for your child to open an account just to get a Visa card.; , If you have excellent credit, you might give your child a good shot at getting a Visa card by co-signing for it. Of course, you'll be responsible if your child doesn't pay the amount that's due every month. You already know if your child has good character, so decide if you want to assume the risk accordingly.   Keep in mind that not all credit card issuers allow for co-signers., Once you've found what you think is the best deal, you should assist your child in applying for the credit card. Since it's a first-time experience, your son or daughter will undoubtedly have questions.  , It's often the case that younger people who apply for a credit card for the first time are rejected.

83," Choose the right shoelaces., Hold the two shoelaces together., Thread the laces through the bottom pair of eyelets., Cross ""Side A"" diagonally upward., Cross ""Side B"" diagonally upward., Twist the shoelaces to the other side., Twist and cross until you reach the top., Pull the laces through the top and tie when ready.",How to Lace Converse3," The shoelace length depends on the number of eyelet pairs on your Converse shoes. You will need two different shoelaces in separate colors for this lacing style, but the two laces should be equal in length. You should select flat shoelaces that are fairly thin. Each eyelet will need to hold two layers of shoelace, so it is important that the shoelaces you choose are thin and flat, regardless of length.This lacing technique can be used on Converse with an odd number of eyelet pairs, but it will look most symmetrical with shoes that have an even number of pairs. If using two pairs of eyelets, choose shoelace 28 inches (71 cm) long. If using three pairs of eyelets, choose shoelaces 32 inches (81 cm) in length. If using four pairs of eyelets, choose shoelaces 36 inches (92 cm) long. If using five pairs of eyelets, use shoelaces 40 inches (102 cm) in length. If using six pairs of eyelets, use shoelaces 44 inches (113 cm) long. If using seven pairs of eyelets, use shoelaces 48 inches (123 cm) in length. If using eight pairs of eyelets, choose laces 53 inches (134 cm) long.  , Arrange the two shoelaces so that they are evenly lined up and back-to-back. You should have, in appearance, a flat shoelace with double thickness and two sides. Note that this technique is fairly similar to the criss-cross lacing technique and uses the same general pattern. This is a popular lacing style for converse because it is fun, decorative, and easy to customize. It is slightly harder to tighten and tie than a single-lace method, however, so you should be aware of this fact before choosing this technique.        , Pull the double-laces through the bottom set of eyelets so that ""Color One"" shows. The other lace, ""Color Two,"" should be hidden behind the top lace. The shoelaces should be threaded into the eyelets from the bottom so that the ends come up through the eyelets. The ends should drape over the eyelet sides once this step is completed.        , Pull ""Side A"" out of the bottom left eyelet and through the second-to-bottom right eyelet. Make sure that the shoelaces are twisted so that ""Color Two"" is now on top while ""Color One"" is hidden on the bottom. A diagonal line should connect the bottom and second-to-bottom holes on opposing sides of the Converse. Pull the laces from the underside of the right second-to-bottom hole and over the top.        , Pull ""Side B"" out of the bottom right eyelet and through the second-to-bottom left eyelet. The shoelaces should be twisted to match the other half of the criss-cross. ""Color Two"" should show on the top and ""Color One"" should be hidden on the bottom. The two eyelets should be connected by a diagonal line. Pull the shoelaces through the left eyelet from the underside, letting them drape over the top of the left eyelet once you pull them through.        , Then repeat the crossing procedure. Repeat the criss-crossing pattern, but twist the shoelaces so that Color One is now on top while Color Two is now hidden on the bottom. Alternate ""Side A"" and ""Side B"" back and forth, criss-crossing the eyelets so that each end is pulled through its eyelet and into the eyelet on the opposite side one row up.        , Continue twisting and criss-crossing the shoelaces. Each ""x"" across your shoes should be composed of a single color, but each ""x"" should be the opposite color of the ""x"" beneath it and above it.        , When you pull the shoelaces through the top set of eyelets, it does not matter which side of the double-lace shows. Both sides will show when you tie your shoes. Alternatively, you can make tying the shoes easier by tucking one color shoelace into the top of your shoe and only tying the other color in the front of your shoe. Otherwise, you will tie your shoes using both laces.        ","1. The length of shoelaces for Converse shoes depends on the number of eyelet pairs.
2. Two different shoelaces in separate colors, but equal in length, are needed for this lacing style.
3. Flat, thin shoelaces are recommended for this lacing technique.
4. This lacing style is symmetrical with shoes that have an even number of eyelet pairs.
5. The lacing technique involves pulling double laces through eyelets from the bottom.

84," Deal with impostor syndrome., Remember that racist comments are not about you., Release the stress of being a cultural “representative”., Be informed., Use humor., Find similarities with those around you.",How to Feel Normal if You're from a Different Race1," Impostor syndrome occurs when you believe that your abilities are not up to par as those around you. You may believe you received a scholarship or a job offer because of your race, somehow making you less qualified than those around you. You may try to overachieve as a result of feeling “not good enough” or feel great dissatisfaction or guilt in your studies or profession. You may fear the day the “truth” comes out and people believe you are a fraud. It’s important to recognize that you have value for your own characteristics and achievements.Be aware when feelings of being an impostor come up. Understand the difference between reality and feelings. When feelings come up, use the statement, “Even if I feel undeserving, it doesn’t mean I really am.” If you feel like an impostor, know that you are not alone. Even some high achieving individuals suffer from impostor syndrome. Remind yourself that you work hard and deserve the things you have.; , Remember that racist comments reflect a problem with the person who holds those beliefs, not you. Experiencing prejudice or discrimination does not automatically make you less valuable or mean there is anything wrong with you.It’s important to feel empowered by who you are and not “less than” other people.[   If you do experience prejudice or discrimination, take it seriously. Report the prejudice to someone who can help. For example, school bullies might exclude you from participating in a social group due to your race, or they might call you hurtful names.These are both actions that should be reported to a parent, teacher, counselor, or another figure of authority. You do not deserve this treatment, and you don't have to put up with it.  , If you are a minority in a group of people racially different than you, don’t feel pressure to represent your race.You may feel like people have negative associations with those in your racial group, and you want to prove them wrong. Remember that you can’t change people’s judgments, no matter how hard you try. There is great variation within your race, and you cannot represent everyone as one person.   Don’t allow people to see you as a representative, either. Remind people that while stereotypes exist, everyone is unique and not to judge a whole group by one person.  , When faced with discriminatory comments, be ready to fire back. This can be empowering for you to have a response and to use information as power.When faced with insensitive comments or racism, be ready with events, facts, or statistics that help you educate people that may be less aware of how these comments affect people.   When people are overtly ignorant about other groups, you can help them understand it better. Even a comment like, “When you put Chinese people down, it perpetuates a mentality of them being less than you” is helpful. You can also say, ""When you say that Black people are better at sports, you're essentializing a whole group of people, which isn't fair."" You can also use the power of facts in your favor. For example, if someone makes a remark about how immigrants hurt the community, you can reply that immigrants often own small businesses and contribute to the economy.Or, if someone has said that immigrants are ""criminals,"" you can tell them that immigrants are much less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens., When experiencing stress related to race, empower yourself to not back down. While some people may fire back, you may take a lighter stance by adding a bit of humor to the situation. Especially if you are within a group of friends and someone says something offensive, say something light and funny, yet still makes a point. Using humor can be a bridge to talk about an uncomfortable topic but in a more approachable way. You can say, “""Well, my girlfriend is Indian, and I haven't noticed that with her... should I call her and ask her if that's true?"" or ""That's a cool joke, can you tell it to my Nigerian friend? Do you think he'd like it?""  , It may be easy to see how you differ from those around you, but challenge yourself to see the similarities between yourself and those you feel different from.Remember that underneath all the cultural and physical differences, we share more similarities than differences because we are all human.   As humans, we all feel fear, joy, nervousness, pain, excitement, betrayal, and love. Even when you feel different, remember that despite cultural differences, we have experiential similarities that make us all human. Find activities that you enjoy, and share them with a group. This could be joining a sport team, taking a sewing class, or engaging in any activity that you can enjoy with other people.  ","- Impostor syndrome

An amplifier increases the power available to your speakers while a preamplifier controls everything and needs both an amplifier and speaker to function.A tube amp uses a vacuum tube where a single ended triode tube amp works well with high efficiency speakers. FET amp stands for Field Effect Transistor because it uses an electric field. This type of amp is a popular solid state amp. Class A amps produce almost no distortion with a maximum amount of power. Class B amps produce some distortion and need to be turned on. Class AB amps are a combination of Class A and B where a signal switches between a Class A and B circuit.  , Amplifiers have many different configurations that can be based on the number of speakers, type of speakers, and room configuration.   If you’re simply using a pair of speakers, stereo amps are a common choice. If you have a number of different high powered speakers, monoblock amps can be setup for each. If your home theater is advanced with five inputs or more, multichannel amps are best.  , Your equipment will depend on how involved your home theater will be but the basic requirements are the input sources, amplifiers, preamplifiers, and cable connectors.Input sources are whatever you choose to plug into your speakers including Blu-Ray players, DVD players, and stereos. Cable connectors should come with input sources but if you need more or need extended lengths, go to your local home theater specialist.  , Your preamp should be easily accessible with space for both input and output cables.If you’re using a home theater cabinet, make sure there is an opening in the back or remove any covering that can obstruct your cables.  , Depending on how many input sources you have, you may need to label each cable. Keep your cables organized as you connect them to your preamp.Wrap masking tape near the plug of the connector and label each source.  , Run cables from the back of your input devices to input plugs in your preamplifier.   Ensure that you’re using the right cable and are connecting it to the right input plug in the preamp as there can be many plugs. Ensure that the plug is firmly connected to the slot.  , Connect cables from the output terminals of your preamp to input plugs at the back of your amplifier. Your amplifier will be connected to your speakers via the output terminals.Do not connect a two channel amp to more than two speakers because it will damage your amp.  , Choose your input source and turn on your amplifier and preamplifier. Never connect your amplifier while the power is on as it will create a power surge and, depending on your volume control, a nasty sound.While any amp can be used with any preamp, they can also come as a single integrated unit. The difference between a single unit and a 2-piece combination is the flexibility you have when setting up your home theater and the power you can have available to you.  ","- Amplifier and preamplifier are essential components for a home theater

86," Reduce distance!, When you have the gun, back up quickly., Tap, rack, activate and aim., Pointing a loaded gun at a floored opponent should end the confrontation, enabling you to walk away.",How to Disarm Your Opponent2," Guns are effective at extended ranges, so it is essential to reduce distance if attacked with a firearm. Each of these techniques can be adapted for pistols and also long rifles.   If the attacker is pointing the gun at your face, it is essential to redirect the line of fire upwards to reduce the chance of collateral damage. Do so by placing the balls of your hands together and making a V with your hands. Your fingers should remain spread, however, to ensure that you can grasp the gun. Remember that your opponent is expecting some sort of reaction, so try to fuse this with a feigned raising of your arms. Grasp the barrel of the gun from underneath with the aforementioned V hand positioning. Do not grab the handle or your opponent's hands. Push up and then quickly pull down. As you pull down, step in and push your hands forward to crank the opponent's wrist back and point the gun vertically. Kick the knees or groin to disconnect your opponent. You are also in a position to twist the gun sideways. Doing so, and then quickly pulling back should force your opponent to release the gun by hyper extending the thumb.       For a gun pointed to the chest, the defense is the same as for a knife thrust to the chest. The choke hold is particularly useful here as an arm bar may be hazardous.       If the gun is aimed to the back of the head, rapidly turning into the attacker will result in his arm being next to your head. Clamp it down and finish with knee strikes to the groin, bladder, and liver, and palm strikes to the head.       If the gun is behind you, glance over your shoulder. Your opponent will be expecting this reaction. Turn and use your hips to push the arm towards the assailant's line of symmetry. Finish as in the first example.        , Create distance.  , Tap the magazine well to ensure that it is properly seated, pull back on the feeding slide to insert a fresh round and clear any jam that may have resulted from the struggle. Check the safety and aim the gun with both hands.   If the gun is a revolver, pull the hammer back into single action mode because some revolvers are single action only. Also, the trigger pull will be lessened, making a reflex shot easier.        , However, if you must fire, fire two reflexive shots to the chest with minimal effective aiming followed by a single shot to the head with careful aiming.   If you must fire while backing up, (before the tap, rack, aim) fire from the hip. Clamp the gun against your hip, being sure to lower the shoulder so that the slide doesn't hit your forearm. Stand with the gun-side foot back.        ","- Guns are effective at extended ranges

Christmas shopping can start December 26th. Although you may feel the last thing you want to do is shop after the Christmas rush, stores often have incredible sales immediately after the holidays, and most items will be perfectly good gifts the next year.   Check out sales throughout the year, such as at the end of summer. After-Christmas and Boxing Day sales are a good time to pick up wrapping paper and the like for the next year for a pittance.  , Many people end up shopping last-minute because they put off the inevitable. Instead, make a plan with solid goals, dates, and timelines.   For instance, shopping will be done by December 20th. Put aside two evenings, twice a week for 2 weeks to accomplish this task. Leave some wiggle-room in case something comes up, but don't keep making excuses. It can help to have someone who is good about shopping to keep you on track.  , Maybe you're not the type of person who likes shopping, or don't have the time to browse for Christmas presents all year long. Instead, put aside one period of time, like a weekend or a special shopping trip.  , Don't lose the present or forget who you bought it for.   Have a designated area for presents, such as a tote, section of closet, or attic. Be sure that the present won't be ruined by variations of temperature, humidity, mold, mice, and so on. Write the name of the designated gift-receiver on a removable sticker or piece of tape. That way you'll remember who you bought it for. If you change your mind, it's easy to re-designate. Cross their name off the list as soon as possible to avoid forgetting that you already bought them something.  , Hiding is the hardest part of buying a gift early, but it's perfectly possible. If you live with the person, hide it in your craft cupboard, toy box, the back of a wardrobe, etc. and leave it inside backpacks or other opaque bags. It's best to choose somewhere the other person is not likely to look.  ","- Budgeting for Christmas presents throughout the year

88," Start by learning to count to five., Learn the numbers for six through ten., Put it all together to count to ten., Memorize the numbers 11 through 15., Study the numbers 16 through 19., Count in tens., Understand how to form other numbers., Review basic accentuation rules., Watch TV shows or movies in Spanish., Listen to Spanish music., Talk to native speakers.",How to Count up to 10 in Spanish," It may be easier for you to learn how to count to ten (and beyond!) if you split the numbers into chunks. Memorizing shorter sequences is easier than trying to learn all the numbers at once. Repeat the words until you can say them without thinking.Although not typically included in counting, you can say zero in Spanish as cero (SAY-roh). One in Spanish is uno (OO-noh). Two in Spanish is dos (doss). Three in Spanish is tres (tress). Four in Spanish is cuatro (KWA-tro). Five in Spanish is cinco (SEEN-ko).; , Once you've committed the Spanish words for numbers one through five to memory, you're ready to move on to the next set of numbers. Repeat the new numbers over and over until you know them as well as you know one through five.Six in Spanish is seis (SAISS). Seven in Spanish is siete (SYE-te). Eight in Spanish is ocho (O-cho). Nine in Spanish is nueve (NWAI-be). Ten in Spanish is diez (DYESS).  , When you have both sets of numbers memorized, all you have to do is put them in a single series and say them all together. You now know how to count up to 10 in Spanish.Count to ten repeatedly until the words are automatic for you. One way to incorporate the Spanish words into your every day life is to try to automatically think of the Spanish word for the number when you're looking at a number of items. For example, if you have a bowl of fruit in your kitchen that has two apples, three bananas, and seven oranges, you might think to yourself that there are dos apples, tres bananas, and siete oranges. It doesn't matter whether you know the Spanish words for those fruits.  , There's no point in stopping once you've learned to count up to 10 in Spanish. Using the same strategy you did when you learned to count to ten, learn the Spanish words for the numbers 11 through 15. The Spanish language has unique words for these numbers.For 11, say once (OHN-say). For 12, say doce (DOH-say). For 13, say trece (TRAY-say). For 14, say catorce (kah-TOHR-say). For 15, say quince (KEEN-say).  , When you learn numbers 16 through 19, you're also learning how all the other numbers in Spanish are formed. You'll take the word for 10, diez, include an ee sound (""y"" in Spanish means ""and""), and then the word for the second digit.16 is dieciséis (DYEESS-ee-SAYSS). 17 is diecisiete (DYEESS-ee-SYAY-tay). 18 dieciocho (DYEESS-ee-OH-choh). 19 is diecinueve (DYEESS-ee-NWAY-bay).  , To figure out how to form other numbers in Spanish, you'll have to memorize the base numbers by learning how to count in tens. These number words are the building blocks for saying larger numbers in Spanish.For 20, say veinte (BAYN-tay). For 30, say treinta (TRAYN-tah). For 40, say cuarenta (kwah-RAYN-tah). For 50, say cincuenta (seen-KWAYN-tah). For 60, say sesenta (say-SAYN-tah). For 70, say setenta (say-TAYN-tah). For 80, say ochenta (oh-CHAYN-tah). For 90, say noventa (noh-BAYN-tah).  , Now that you know how to count to 10, and you know how to count in tens, you can easily combine your knowledge to say or write in Spanish any number up to 99.Keep in mind that the spelling may differ, and you may need to stress different syllables. However, if you understand the basics of how numbers are formed, you can at least recognize any number you see or hear in Spanish. As with everything else, remember to practice this skill regularly and repeat the numbers to yourself at least once every few days. Over time, counting in Spanish will become second nature to you.  , In Spanish, if you see an accent mark over a letter, it tells you that you are supposed to stress or emphasize that syllable when you pronounce the word. Some Spanish words are spelled the same way, but mean entirely different things depending on which syllable is stressed.The essential accentuation rule in Spanish is that if the word ends in a vowel, an n, or an s, you'll put stress on the next to last syllable. With any other word, you'll stress the last syllable. However, if the word has an accent mark, you stress that syllable and ignore the general rule. For example, in your numbers, you may have noticed an accent in the word for 16, dieciséis. This means that you should stress the last syllable, despite the fact that it ends with an s.   , Listening to people speak Spanish can help you understand more about how the words fit together and how they're said in the context of normal conversation.Actors typically pronounce their words without excessive regional dialect – unless the show or movie takes place in a specific geographic area. This makes it easier for you to learn the language. Keep in mind that Spanish is spoken in many countries all over the world, giving rise to multiple dialects and variations. Even for a native speaker, someone from another country can be difficult to understand.  , Music can be an easy way to learn a language because of the rhythm and repetitiveness of the lyrics. If you find music with Spanish lyrics that appeals to you, listening to it on a regular basis can help you understand how words are pronounced.If you think back to how you learned your first language, you'll probably recall that there was a lot of music involved. Songs are a very efficient way to learn words and how they fit together. You may not understand exactly what something means, but the important part when you're just beginning to learn Spanish is to listen to the way the words are pronounced and how the language sounds.  , When you're learning any no language, there's nothing better to enhance your understanding of the language and the way the words are spoken than to talk to people who are fluent in the language.Native speakers also can correct your pronunciation and give you tips on how to pronounce the words correctly. Particularly if you have another language in common, a native speaker may be able to give you tips on how to pronounce words in Spanish that you wouldn't have picked up on otherwise.

Common causes of transmission include:Sexual contact with an infected partner. Transmission can occur via blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and saliva. Transmission through infected needles. This includes people who may be sharing needles for intravenous drug use and it includes health care workers who may be at risk of accidental needle sticks. Transmission during childbirth. If the mother is infected, she may transmit it to her infant during birth. However, if the mother knows that she is infected, the infant can be vaccinated upon birth.; , If you think you may have been exposed to hepatitis B, see a doctor immediately. If you receive care within 12 hours, it may prevent the infection. You doctor will likely do the following:Give you an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin to boost your immune response Vaccinate you against hepatitis B  , Symptoms usually start one to four months after the initial exposure. Symptoms may include:Abdominal pain Dark urine Fever Joint pain Not being hungry Vomiting and nausea Feeling weak and tired Jaundice (your skin and the whites of your eyes turn yellowish)  , The doctor may do several tests.The doctor will confirm the presence of the virus with a blood test and whether it is acute or chronic. The doctor might also do a liver biopsy to see if you have liver damage. This involves removing a very small piece of liver tissue through a thin needle and analyzing the tissue in the lab.  , Most cases of hepatitis B are acute. Acute cases of hepatitis B, contrary to what the name might suggest, are infections that will go away on their own. 95% of cases will clear on their own and the illness illness typically goes away within a few weeks and liver function is normal within six months. Treatment is usually not indicated in the acute stage.   Get plenty of bed rest, drink lots of fluids, and stick with healthy foods. This will help your body clear the virus efficiently.If you are in pain, discuss what painkillers your doctor recommends, even for over the counter medications (acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen) or herbal supplements. You don’t want to take anything that will be hard on your liver.Schedule follow-up blood tests with your doctor to track the natural course of the infection. These blood tests will help your doctor determine whether the virus is being cleared. If your liver is becoming damaged, your doctor may recommend lamivudine (Epivir)., If your body has not cleared the virus within a few months, you may have chronic hepatitis B. Your doctor is likely to prescribe medications if you show the following symptoms:High virus levels in your blood Decreasing liver function Signs of long-term liver damage and scarring (cirrhosis)  , There are several possibilities depending upon your age and circumstances.Antiviral medications can reduce the viral load in your body. Possibilities include lamivudine (Epivir), adefovir (Hepsera), telbivudine (Tyzeka) and entecavir (Baraclude). These medications will slow the progression of the disease and decrease your chances of sustaining liver damage.Interferon-alpha is a medication which contains a synthetic version of the protein your body makes to fight the virus. This option is often given to younger people who may want to become pregnant in the next few years and do not want to have a long treatment process. However, it has significant side effects including depression, anxiety, flu-like symptoms, breathing problems, a tight feeling in the chest, and hair loss.Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues are substances that prevent the virus from replicating. Some well known ones include adefovir (Hepsera), entecavir (Baraclude), lamivudine (Epivir-HBV, Heptovir, Heptodin), telbivudine (Tyzeka) and tenofovir (Viread). However, these medications have a serious drawback in that the virus may mutate and develop resistance to these drugs after several years of use., If necessary a surgeon can remove your liver and replace it with a healthy one.   Sometimes a piece of a healthy liver from a living donor may be used.  , Even though medications can reduce the number of viruses in the blood to nearly zero, low numbers of the virus still live in the liver and elsewhere.Monitor yourself for resurgences of the disease and if you feel the symptoms returning, go to the doctor immediately. Ask your doctor what he or she recommends for long-term follow up.  , It won’t spread through casual contact, but it could through the exchange of bodily fluids.Be open with your partner and encourage him or her to get tested and vaccinated. Use a condom during sex to reduce the risk of transmission. Don’t share needles, syringes, razors or toothbrushes, all of which could have small amounts of infected blood on them.  , This includes alcohol, recreational drugs, and over the counter drugs or supplements.Alcohol itself can damage the liver, so you should abstain from drinking alcohol to protect your liver while your body fights the infection. Avoid recreational drugs which may cause liver damage. Ask your doctor which over the counter medications you can take for mild conditions like a cold, flu, or headache. Even over the counter medications may burden your liver when it is in a damaged or vulnerable state.  , You will not infect friends through casual contact and the social support is important for your psychological and physical health.   Seek out support groups for people with liver disease.Remind yourself that with appropriate treatment and monitoring, the prognosis for people with hepatitis B is usually very good.

94," Make things easier., Steer clear of harmful substances., Manage your stress levels., Eat a heart-healthy diet., Quit smoking., Exercise regularly., Take medications.",How to Live with Atrial Fibrillation1," While living with AF can be challenging, there are ways that you can make dealing with AF easier. These are habits that should be followed every day to help make life easier for you. These include:   Taking all medications exactly as prescribed Continuing to take any prescription medication unless your healthcare provider says otherwise Discussing any medicine-caused side effects with your healthcare provider Monitoring your pulse daily, especially if you have an artificial pacemaker Keeping a record of your pulse along with the day and time the pulse was taken and notes about how you felt at the time; , There are some substances that can make your atrial fibrillation worse and that contribute to an irregular heartbeat. Because of this, you should avoid the substances such as:   Sodium, which can increase your blood pressure, which triggers AFCaffeine Tobacco Alcohol, which trigger AF in some individuals Cold and cough medications Appetite suppressants Psychotropic drugs used to treat certain mental illnesses Antiarrhythmic in certain individuals, although they are used to treat arrhythmia as well Anti-migraine drugs Drugs for erectile dysfunction Street drugs such as cocaine, marijuana, “speed”, or methamphetamines  , High stress levels can increase your blood pressure, which can worsen your AF. High stress levels can also cause other heart diseases because it causes the constriction of your blood vessels. To reduce your stress levels:   Reduce your exposure to your stressors Create a schedule for yourself Take breaks throughout the day Practice yoga Set aside some time each day to meditate, There is not a specific diet that is for AF patients; however, your diet can be tailored to the underlying cause and prevention of AF, as well as to lower the risk of stroke and heart attack. You can also create a diet that reduces the conditions that can make your AF worse. Eat more vegetables and fruit, avoid large portion sizes, and eat whole grains instead of refined carbohydrates, which include white breads, white rice, pastries, and dessert cakes.   A diet that is low in refined sugars can help to reduce your blood sugar levels and lower your chance of AF. A diet that is low in fat, particularly saturated fat, can help to reduce your cholesterol, which contributes to heart issues. A diet that is low in sodium can help to reduce your blood pressure, which lowers your risk of AF and other heart issues., Nicotine can cause atrial fibrillation. In addition, tobacco smoke causes the constriction of your blood vessels, which can lead to high blood pressure and can make your AF worse. It also decreases the amount of oxygen in your blood, while the nicotine can do damage to your heart. It can also lead to many other heart problems, including coronary artery disease and stroke. If you are having a hard time quitting:   Talk to your doctor about methods and medications you can use to quit. Join a support group for people who are trying to quit smoking., Your heart is a muscle, and like any other muscle, it needs to be worked out. Doing cardiovascular exercises will help work out your heart and decrease your risk of AF and other heart diseases. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise five days a week for a total of 150 minutes, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise. Also make sure you include two to three days of strength training.   Focus on light cardio exercises that can help to get your blood pumping. Some light cardio exercises that work well include fast-paced walking, light jogging, casual cycling, and light swimming. Increase how long or strenuous your fitness levels are when you get stronger. Start moderate to intense cardio or your light cardio for longer periods of time once you get used to light cardio. Make sure you ask your doctor which exercises you can safely do with your heart issues., There are established guidelines and treatments for atrial fibrillation using certain medications. The three main factors to be considered are the control of your heart rate, conversion of your atrial fibrillation to normal, and anticoagulation therapy. Your doctor will decide on the class of medication and individual dosing to provide you with based on a full physical workup. The four classes of medications for control of the ventricular heart rate are:   Beta blockers such as metoprolol, which reduce blood pressure by blocking the effects of epinephrine Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil and diltiazem Digoxin, which increases the intensity of heart muscle contraction without increasing the length of contraction Amiodarone, which causes a prolonged phase of the heart contraction  ","- Follow daily habits to make dealing with AF easier

Ideally, they should have locking nuts on them to prevent this.  ,, How’s the carpet. This is best looked at while the boat’s off the trailer.  , Corrosion can also be a problem on aluminum trailers that visit salt water frequently.  , This keeps you from slinging rock onto the boat’s paint job.","- Checking functionality of lights and flashers

99," Prepare yourself., Practice., Make sure you use the best car for what you need., Buy the perfect chauffeur vehicle., Prepare the car., Tailor your greeting to the person you are talking to., During the drive, pass from the front of the car, open the door gently, get in as a gentleman (don't fall into the seat like a brick falls from the sky), start the engine, close the door gently, put your seat belt on, and drive off nicely and gently., Arrive at your destination.",How to Chauffeur," Make sure your hygiene is ""Perfect"". Put on a nice suit, shave, and use some perfume if you're a woman.; , Take a lot of time practicing tasks such as parking a big car in a tight car park or parking spot, gently accelerating/turning and braking the ""chauffeur"" car. Get familiar with the car you will be using.  , Below are some examples:   If you chauffeur your kids or friends around everyday, you probably don't need any special transportation vehicle; your daily family car will fit the deal. If you chauffeur your wife/girlfriend/mother for the weekend in short distances, your daily family car will fit the deal perfectly once more. If you are going on a longer trip and you have a car that belongs to the ""touring"" car category, such as BMW 5/7 series, an Audi A6/A8, or a Mercedes E/S class, or this type of vehicle, prefer this one because they have a more comfortable ride. They offer a good variety of equipment whether it is for safety, comfort or entertainment.  , If you are planning to buy another car to be the chauffeur car, look at your needs and the available budget first.   For a low to medium budget there is lots of cars out there that are very comfortable, safe, and built to ""eat"" kilometers/miles. Search brands that have a long history record on luxury cruisers, because these companies know how to build very good cruisers. If you have a medium to high budget, consider cars such as BMW 7 Series, Audi A8, Mercedes S Class, Lexus LS Series, etc. If you have a budget that is higher than the average high budget, consider a GT (Gran Turismo), or category cars such as the Aston Martin Rapide, Aston Martin DB9, Bentley Continental Flying Spur, Bentley Mulsanne, Ferrari 612 Scaglietti, Ferrari FF, etc. Remember there are thousands of good condition used luxury or hyper-luxury cars that are the bargains of the century.  , The car that is used should always be as clean as possible, fully filled up with gas, and well maintained so that it won't break down or do strange noises during the drive. It's also important to do the regular checks such as fluid level, tyre pressure, and other everyday maintenance.  , A typical greeting (as you would always greet them) is okay. If you will also have somebody in the car who is a stranger for you or someone much older than you, make a gentleman greeting and open the door for him. If you chauffeur someone with high reputation (you will probably be a chauffeur for a living in this option) greet them again as a gentleman and open the door for him.  , Try to drive at the speed of the traffic flow and avoid constant overtaking. Be sure to stop gently and also drive off gently. When overtaking. Try not to accelerate too hard or floor it because high speeds could scare some passengers.   A V8 is good entry level engine, as it has good low end and medium end torque, so you don't have to downshift or accelerate too hard. The V12 engine is the boss in these cars because it has a lot of torque, so you almost don't need to downshift. You just have to press a bit more on the accelerator. V12 engines also are extremely smooth and quiet in the way they deliver both power and torque. If you are chauffeuring your family and friends, you can show them what your V8 Charger or Bi-Turbo V12 S600 can do, but avoid doing that when you are transporting a stranger. You can accelerate a bit more quickly from time to time and, if you see that he/she likes it, then it's okay if you drive a bit faster, especially if it is going to make the ride a bit more exciting. However, you should still always obey traffic laws and never break the speed limit.  , If you transfer your family/friends stop as close to your destination as possible, let them get off the car so you don't have to carry them with you while searching for an empty parking spot. If an elderly passenger or a passenger with special needs requires assistance, provide it. If you have an important passenger (minister, star, singer etc) in the car, stop, turn on the hazard lights, and open the door for them. Then find a place to park the car.
