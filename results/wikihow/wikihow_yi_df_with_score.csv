Add a couple of teaspoons of ginger, one teaspoon of menthol ointment (over-the-counter), or several drops of eucalyptus oil. Go to a sink with water warm enough to form steam and fill the sink with hot water. You’ll also need a towel, so have one handy. Drape the towel over the back of your head so the ends drop around either side of your head. Breathe in the steam for a few minutes.; , Taking a warm shower before work can also help to relieve some of your congestion. This is another form of steam remedy. Make sure the bathroom door is closed so the steam from the shower builds.Shower as normal with very warm water.   This is only going to be practical at home.  , If you have a throbbing and congested head compounded by difficulty breathing through the nose then a compress is one way to go. Take a thick set of paper towels or clean linen cloth and soak it in warm water. Wrench or squeeze it out so it doesn’t drip everywhere. Allow it to rest on your forehead. Don’t let the water get so hot it burns you.This can be done at home and work.  , You can try this for a throat remedy. Honey is a good soothing substance for a sore throat and cough. Mix in a teaspoon with some hot tea for a beverage.This can be done at home or work. You may want to prepare the mix at home and put the drink in an insulated thermos to take to work.  , This is one environmental solution. If you want to use this at work you will need to be in a relatively small area or it won’t be too effective. And you will need permission most likely. Clean the machine with a solution of bleach every few days to stop the growth of mold or bacteria.The humidifier moistens the air, which can ease congestion in the head and chest.  , This is one oral method you can try. Mixing in a teaspoon of salt with warm water to gargle with can be a quick way to relieve a sore throat at work.You want to do this in the bathroom of your work place.  , Remove the cap. Insert the nozzle into one of your clogged nasal passages. Squeeze in one or two drops while simultaneously clamping shut the other nostril. Inhale deeply. Release the clamped nostril. Follow the instructions on the label to be more precise.Saline or salt water sprays are simple over-the-counter nasal rinses that can thin mucus, relieve postnasal drip, and moisten dry nasal passages. These sprays also have some benefits for removing viruses and bacteria from the nose. They are not medicated so are usually very safe for adults and even kids.  , Open the cap. Insert the tip into one nostril and squirt in one or two pumps. Do the same for the other nostril. You may need to follow other instructions according to your doctor, pharmacist, and/or the label.These are medicated and relieve swollen or stuffy noses. Generally these are safe for most conditions including the flu, but if you’re using this for more than three days you need to stop and see a doctor. Using for more than three days can result in medication induced rebound congestion. These come in pill form too. However, either the pill or spray decongestants can increase blood pressure and heart rate. Two common forms of the oral variety are pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine—both over-the-counter. If you are going to be working then your blood pressure and heart rate may fluctuate more from the daily stress. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about safety issues.  , There are several types of over-the-counter cough syrups that fight the cough by different means in the case of the flu. You’ll want to have one of these with you while at work if you have a coughing fit. You can try a suppressant or an expectorant (such as guaifenesin) to force up mucus.Cough drops and throat lozenges are a great way to treat a cough and/or sore throat at home and at work. Keep some sugar-free cough drops or throat lozenges on hand all day. Less practical for work and more for home treatment of coughs would be topical treatments like menthol rubs for your chest.  , Nasal strips can help to open your nasal passages and make breathing easier. One of these can fit on the lower third of your nose. A plastic strip under a bandage like strip springs out to gently pull open your nose and this eases your breathing. You can easily wear this at work all day., Colds and flus can be painful, so taking an over-the-counter pain reliever may help. Make sure that you follow the dosage instructions on the package. Ingest the pills with plenty of water. Place extra pills in a pill box or keep the bottle in a handy place such as a purse, bag, or desk drawer.Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or other analgesics like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve) are available over-the-counter for pain relief. These medicines also reduce fever. Make sure that you check the ingredients on any cold or flu medicine you are taking. Many of these medicines already contain a pain reliever and it is important to avoid doubling up on these. This can cause severe problems, such as kidney damage.  , If your illness is viral, then taking an antiviral medication may help. Talk to your doctor about getting these medicines prescribed. Have the medicine administered within 48 hours of the onset of your illness.Usually these medicines such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), peramivir (Rapivab), or zanamivir (Relenza) are best if taken within 48 hours of onset of the flu, but can still work if taken later. However, these drugs can have more pronounced side effects. Consult with your doctor about these drugs or if you need medicine for another illness.  ","1.

2," Identify the buyer, seller, and the reason for the contract., Provide a description of the vehicle., Be sure that the information is accurate., State the date of the sale and the purchase price., Indicate the delivery method., Describe the condition of the vehicle., Explain what document the Seller will provide to the Buyer., Specify the status of the title., Sign and date the contract.",How to Write a Contract for Selling a Car2," The first sentence of the contract should identify the full legal names of both the buyer and the seller and state that the contract is for the sale of a car. For example, “This is a contract made between the Seller, Joe Smith, and the buyer, Dan Jones, for the sale of Joe Smith’s 1995 Honda Civic sedan.”   Provide the buyer’s and seller’s addresses as well. You may also want to provide the driver license numbers of both the buyer and the seller for identification and verification purposes.  , Use as many identifying characteristics of the car as possible.Be specific; if the contract only identifies the model and year of the car as “1990 Toyota Camry” and the owner has two 1990 Toyota Camrys, it would be unclear which car the contract means. Include as many of the following details as possible:   Color Year Make and model Body type (pickup, SUV, 4 door sedan) Interior color Any other unique features of the car (including cosmetic or mechanical problems) Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) Odometer reading For example, “The vehicle is a silver 1995 Honda Civic LX with black leather interior and a sunroof. The VIN number is 123456789 and the odometer reads 167,000 as of March 14, 2011.”  , Fraudulent claims about the details of the car or the terms of the sale can lead a contract to be voidable. Be sure that all parties understand each other and that no one is misrepresenting the vehicle or the funds that will be exchanged for the vehicle.For example, if the owner of the car notes that the car has 167,000 miles on it in the contract, but knows that the vehicle actually has 200,000 miles and a faulty odometer, the entire contract may be voided. If the odometer has ever been replaced or repaired, state this in the contract. You can use the following boilerplate language: “I certify that the car’s odometer was altered for repair or replacement purposes while in my possession, and that the mileage registered on the repaired or replaced odometer was identical to that before service.”, Describe the method of payment for the purchase—cash, personal check, cashier’s check, money order, etc.For example, “The date of sale is March 14, 2011. Buyer agrees to pay to Seller the purchase price of $500 to be paid in cash.”   Though not recommended, you can also stipulate an agreed to payment plan. For example, the buyer might pay $250/month for sixteen months. Only agree to a payment plan if you know the person to whom you are selling the car. A common fraud scheme is for someone to give an initial payment, then take the vehicle and disappear. If you do agree to a payment plan, be sure that you hold the car’s title until the payments have all been made in full. After all payments are complete, you can send the title to the new owner via certified mail. State whether the purchase price is inclusive of sales taxes. In some states, you must charge sales tax. You can state in the contract that your purchase price includes this sales tax (“inclusive of all sales taxes”), or decide that sales tax is additional to the price (“exclusive of all sales taxes”).  , If the car sale is not local, the delivery method and responsibility should be included in the contract. Options include: shipping the vehicle,delivery by the seller, pick-up by the buyer, or delivery by a third party. If expenses will be incurred during delivery (such as with shipping the vehicle or return flight or rental car for an owner delivery), the contract should indicate who is responsible for paying the delivery expenses.   Make everything clear. For example, if you live in Georgia and will drive the sold car to the buyer’s home in Alabama and then fly home, state who will be responsible for the gas to drive the car to Alabama and for your flight home: “Seller will drive the car to Buyer’s home in Alabama and agrees to pay for all gas and maintenance costs until delivery is made. Buyer agrees to pay Seller’s flight home at a cost of $175.”  , Sellers usually sell cars “as is,” which limits the seller’s liability for any problems with the car’s condition. A statement that the car is sold “as is” and that the owner “makes no warranties about the condition of the car” is sufficient.Boilerplate language regarding the condition of the vehicle can read as follows: “The is being sold “as is” and the Seller expressly disclaims any and all warranties expressed or implied. The Seller disclaims any warranty as to the condition or working order of the car. The Seller assumes no liability in connection with with the sale of the car.”, State that the Seller will provide the Buyer with the vehicle’s title and any other required documents, such as a recent emissions test report or service records. Contact your state’s DMV regarding any other documentation that a seller must provide a buyer.  , An owner may only sell a vehicle if it has a clear title, which means that there are no liens on the title for car loans or other legal action against the owner. In some cases, a seller can sell a car when the bank still holds the title (i.e., the seller still owes money on the car).   You can include “boilerplate” language to indicate the status of the title if you own the car, such as the following: “The Seller warrants that 1) the Seller is the legal owner of the car; 2) the car is free from all liens and encumbrances; 3) the Seller has full right and authority to sell and transfer the car; and 4) the Seller will warrant and defend the title of the car against any and all claims and demands of all persons.”Get a payoff letter from the financing company if you are still making payments on the car. This will provide exactly the amount of money that you still owe on the car, and which your buyer must pay to purchase the car.In most cases where a bank holds the vehicle title, the buyer writes one check directly to the bank for the payoff amount and another check to the seller for the remaining amount between the payoff and the sales price. In this case, the bank can usually mail the title to the buyer upon receiving the correct payoff amount., Each party should sign and date the contract. Make a copy of the contract after everyone signs. One party should retain the original and one party should retain a copy. It does not matter who retains the copy versus the original. A witness should also sign the contract after each party has signed the contract. Though it may not be legally required to have a witness to the sale of a car in most states,having a witness to the contract may mitigate legal disputes about the accuracy of the contract. You can also sign the contract in front of a notary, if you wish. This adds another layer of protection, as the notary provides solid evidence that both of you are who you claimed and that you both agreed to the terms of the contract.","1. **Full Legal Names and Addresses**: Identify both the buyer and seller by their full legal names and provide their addresses.

2. **Car Details**: Specify the car's make, model, year, body type, color, interior color, unique features, VIN, and odometer reading.

3. **Car Condition**: State that the car is sold ""as is"" and the seller disclaims any warranties about the car's condition.

4. **Payment Method**: Specify the method of payment (cash, check, etc.) and whether the purchase price includes sales taxes.

5. **Delivery and Responsibility**: Describe how the car will be delivered (e.g., seller's delivery, buyer's pick-up, third-party delivery) and who is responsible for delivery expenses.

6. **Title and Documents**: Agree that the seller will provide the buyer with the car's title and any required documents.

7. **Title Status**: Ensure the car has a clear title, with no liens or encumbrances.

8. **Payoff Letter**: Obtain a payoff letter from the financing company to determine the exact amount owed on the car.

9. **Signatures and Witness**: Each party signs the contract, a witness signs, and a copy is made for each party. This can be done in front of a notary for added protection.

10. **Fraud Prevention**: Include language that fraudulent claims about the car's details or the terms of the sale can lead to the contract being voided.

11. **Mutual Understanding**: Ensure that all parties understand each other's rights and obligations under the contract.

By including all these elements, the contract becomes a comprehensive agreement that protects both the buyer and the seller, ensuring clarity, honesty, and accountability throughout the car sale process.",8.280520186069271e-79,0.3026706231454006,0.10149253731343283,0.20178041543026706,0.8072150349617004,0.8663185238838196,0.8357231616973877,0.2843791469706675
3," Give Gravedigger items to the Pig King., Wait for an earthquake in the Caverns., Kill the Bunnymen you find in the Caverns., Go fishing in the Ruins.",How to Farm Gold in Don’t Starve2," Sometimes, you’ll find large patches of raised soil every now and then when exploring the world, or some headstones lying around in the Forest. Those are graves, and you can dig those up with a Shovel, which you can make for 2 Twigs and 2 Flint in your Science Machine. If you’ve dug up some graves and found some odd little things, you can take them to the Pig King, and chances are, he’ll accept them for quite a few pieces of Gold, normally more than what most Meats can net you.   The items you might dig up from graves include knots, buttons, toys, and a lawn gnome, which apparently amuses the Pig King immensely, judging by the amount of Gold he hands you. Graves, and therefore items from them, are non-renewable and scarce in the original game, however, and must be considered as a sort of last resort if you need a lot of Gold at once. In the Reign of the Giants DLC of the PC edition and the console edition, these items can sometimes be found by breaking open Tumbleweeds in the Desert, but it’s still not very reliable despite the yield.  , Caverns are found by mining a large, craggy boulder called a Plugged Sinkhole you sometimes encounter while exploring, and going down the revealed hole in the ground. An earthquake would naturally and randomly happen underground, and would normally net you a small amount of Gold once it ends, though you’d have to be careful during it as rocks are constantly falling and will damage the player when hit with a falling rock.   You can sometimes trigger earthquakes by detonating Gunpowder and Slurtle Slime while in the Caverns. You can make Gunpowder by combining a Rotten Egg, Charcoal, and Nitre, and you can get Slurtle Slime by killing Slurtles, which look like an odd combination of turtle and slug, or feeding them plenty of Rocks.  , Sometimes, when exploring the Caverns, you will encounter giant white rabbits hopping around, or a carrot-shaped house. These Bunnymen are the underground equivalent of the Pigs, which means you could befriend them with carrots and they will aid you for as long as their loyalty lasts. You can also kill them by hitting them with a weapon or tool, or by letting them fight monsters for you. Killing them will net you a carrot, a piece of meat, and occasionally, a Bunny Puff, which you can trade to the Pig King for 2 Gold Nuggets. However, it’s an uncommon drop from the Bunnymen despite its worth.  , The Ruins is a layer lower than the Caverns and accessed by mining an orange pile of rock and going down in the resulting hole. When you find a pond and fish in the Ruins, you’ll get an Eel, which is renewable and worth a good 5 Gold Nuggets each when traded to the Pig King, unlike other Meat items. Fishing in the Ruins is reserved for late-game ventures, though, since the area is very dangerous.  ","1. Graves: Large patches of raised soil or headstones found in the world, containing items such as knots, buttons, toys, and a lawn gnome. These items can be dug up with a Shovel, crafted from Twigs and Flint in a Science Machine.

2. Pig King: A character who accepts items from graves in exchange for a significant amount of Gold. The lawn gnome is particularly valued by the Pig King.

3. Non-renewable and scarce: Graves and items from them are considered a last resort for obtaining Gold, as they are limited in the original game.

4," Identify troubling situations., Step back from your thoughts., Challenge negative thoughts., Find support., Get professional help.",How to Prevent Negative People from Hurting Your Confidence2," Think about the people that seem to deflate your confidence. Again, understand that their words are more a reflection of their own inadequacies, and not yours. Realize that negative thoughts about yourself are coming from someone else’s opinion of you.Remember that you control your opinion of yourself, not others.  , Challenge the accuracy of negative thoughts and feelings. When you are experiencing a wave of negative thoughts, write them down in a personal diary so you can observe them and challenge them. Cognitive behavioral therapy can also be a helpful way to change negative thoughts, so you might look into a self-help book such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Dummies by Rhena Branch and Rob Willson. Negative thoughts can be:All or nothing thinking, for example, “If I do not succeed, then I am a total failure.” Jumping to negative conclusions, for example, “I made a mistake today and now everyone will think I am not qualified for this job,” or “My boss (or friend) hasn’t replied so I must have done something to make them angry.” Mistaking feelings for facts, for example, “I feel like a failure so I must be one.” Not giving yourself the credit you deserve, for example, “I only did well because it was easy.”  , Challenge negative ways of thinking with positive ways of thinking. Get outside of your head by responding to your thoughts as if you are a helpful friend or family member. Then, imagine what they would tell you, and tell yourself those things. Adjust your thoughts by:Using hopeful statements, like, “Even though it is tough, I can handle it.” Forgiving yourself, for example, “I made a mistake, but everyone makes mistakes. That is how you learn and grow.” Avoiding ""should"" and ""must"" statements, for example, “I should have done better,” “I must be a failure.” Replace them with more realistic expectations, like, “I should be proud because I did my best,” or “My presentation might not have been perfect, but my audience remained engaged and asked questions.”  , To help you get perspective on the issue, speak with a friend or family member that is removed from the situation. This way, they can give you an unbiased opinion. Make sure it is someone that you trust and that you know will listen and support you.You can say, ""My confidence has been really low lately, and this person in my life is not helping. The way they react makes me feel worse than I did before. What should I do?""  , If you are taking things that people say about you seriously, then this may indicate that you have adopted some negative beliefs about yourself. It is important to deal with these right away to avoid letting them take hold. If you can’t seem to shake negative thoughts or people, then speak to a professional therapist. Talking with someone is beneficial because it will help you redirect the negative energy instead of bottling it up, or letting it out on others or yourself.A professional will be able to help you uproot self-confidence issues.  ","The data emphasizes the importance of self-awareness, self-reflection, and cognitive behavioral strategies in maintaining and enhancing self-confidence. The key concepts can be summarized as follows:

1. **Self-Reflection and External References**: The data highlights the distinction between one's self-perception and others' opinions. It suggests that negative thoughts about oneself are often a reflection of others' opinions, not one's own worth. This encourages individuals to recognize that they have control over their self-esteem, which is not determined by external factors.

2. **Challenging Negative Thoughts**: The data advises writing down negative thoughts to observe and challenge them. It mentions cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a method to change negative thought patterns. This is crucial for identifying and refuting common cognitive distortions such as all-or-nothing thinking, jumping to negative conclusions, and mistaking feelings for facts.

3. **Positive Cognitive Reprogramming**: The data emphasizes the importance of replacing negative thoughts with positive ones. It suggests imagining oneself as a helpful friend or family member to respond to these thoughts, and then telling oneself supportive and realistic statements. This involves using hopeful statements, practicing self-forgiveness, and avoiding rigid ""should"" and ""must"" statements.

4. **Seeking External Perspective**: The data recommends seeking an unbiased opinion from a trusted friend or family member to gain perspective on one's situation. This can help in understanding that one's confidence issues might not be fully understood or appreciated by those directly involved.

5. **Addressing Negative Beliefs**: The data points out that taking seriously what others say about oneself can indicate the presence of negative beliefs about oneself. It advises addressing these beliefs to prevent their growth and impact on self-confidence.

6. **Professional Help**: The data concludes by suggesting that when negative thoughts and external pressures are persistent, seeking professional help is beneficial. A therapist can provide a supportive environment to redirect negative energy, helping individuals to address and overcome self-confidence issues.

In summary, the data advocates for self-awareness, cognitive behavioral strategies, seeking external perspectives, and professional help as essential tools for managing and improving self-confidence. It underscores the importance of recognizing that negative thoughts and feelings are often a result of cognitive distortions and external pressures, and that taking control of one's thought patterns and seeking support when needed is crucial for maintaining and enhancing self-esteem.",5.455837534389811e-232,0.04901960784313726,0.01477832512315271,0.03431372549019608,0.784481942653656,0.8447754979133606,0.8135131001472473,0.07736943907156674
5," Drop everything., Move horizontally., Lay back., Take your time., Relax., Get on your back and ""swim."", Use a stick., Take frequent breaks., Recognize common quicksand areas., Look for ripples., Test the ground in front of you with your walking stick.",How to Get out of Quicksand," If you step into quicksand and you're wearing a backpack or carrying something heavy, immediately take off your backpack or drop what you're carrying. Because your body is less dense than quicksand, you can't fully sink unless you panic and struggle too much or you're weighed down by something heavy.   If it's possible to get out of your shoes, do so. Shoes, especially those with flat, inflexible soles (many boots, for example) create suction as you try to pull them out of quicksand. If you know ahead of time that you are highly likely to encounter quicksand, change out of your boots and either go barefoot or wear shoes that you can pull your feet out of easily.; , If you feel your feet getting stuck, take a quick couple of steps backward before the quicksand takes hold. It usually takes a minute for the mix to liquify, which means the best method of getting yourself unstuck is to not get stuck in the first place.   If your feet do become stuck, avoid taking big lumbering steps to try to get yourself out. Taking a big step forward might unstick one foot, but push your other farther down, making it extremely difficult to completely unstick yourself.  , Sit down and lean back if your feet are stuck fast. Creating a larger ""footprint"" should free your feet by removing the pressure they create, allowing them to float. When you feel them start to come free, roll to your side away from the quicksand and free of its grip. You'll get dirty, but its the quickest and safest way to free yourself., If you're stuck in quicksand, frantic movements will only hurt your cause. Whatever you do, do it slowly. Slow movements will prevent you from agitating the quicksand; vibrations caused by rapid movements can turn otherwise relatively firm ground into more quicksand.   More importantly, quicksand can react unpredictably to your movements. If you move slowly, you can more easily stop an adverse reaction and, by doing so, avoid getting yourself stuck deeper. You're going to need to be patient. Depending on how much quicksand is around you, it could take several minutes or even hours to slowly, methodically get yourself out.  , Quicksand usually isn't more than a couple feet deep, but if you do happen to come across a particularly deep spot, you could very well sink quite quickly down to your waist or chest. If you panic you can sink further, but if you relax, your body's buoyancy will cause you to float.   Breathe deeply. Not only will deep breathing help you remain calm, it will also make you more buoyant. Keep as much air in your lungs as possible. It is impossible to ""go under"" if your lungs are full of air.  , If you sink up to your hips or higher, bend backward. The more you spread out your weight, the harder it will be to sink. Float on your back while you slowly and carefully extricate your legs. Once your legs are free you can inch yourself to safety by using your arms to slowly and smoothly propel yourself backward with your arms in a sweeping motion, as if you were swimming. When you get near the edge of the quicksand, you can roll to hard ground.  , Carry a walking stick any time you're in quicksand country. As soon as you feel your ankles sink, lay the pole on the surface of the quicksand horizontally behind you. Flop onto your back on top of the pole. After a minute or two, you will achieve balance in the quicksand, and you'll stop sinking. Work the pole towards a new position; move it under your hips. The pole will prevent your hips from sinking, so you can slowly pull one leg free, then the other.   Stay flat on your back with your arms and legs fully touching the quicksand and use the pole as a guide. Inch sideways along the pole to firm ground.  , The work of extracting yourself can be exhausting, so you need to work judiciously, conserving your energy before you become too tired.   You do need to move quickly, however, as the pressure of the sand can shut off your blood flow and cause nerve damage, numbing your legs and making it almost impossible to free yourself without help. Contrary to popular movies and television, most quicksand-related fatalities do not occur because you become sucked under, but from exposure or drowning in incoming tides., While quicksand is not a unique kind of soil, it can form anywhere groundwater mixes with sandy soil, creating a distinctive soupy mixture. Learning to anticipate places you might encounter quicksand is the best way to avoid becoming entangled in it.Quicksand most commonly occurs in:   Tidal flats Swamps and marshes Near lake shores Near underground springs  , Be on the lookout for ground that appears unstable and wet, or sand that has unnatural looking ""ripples"" in the texture. You should be able to see water seeping up from below the sand, making quicksand quite visible if you're on the lookout as you're hiking around.  , Always bring a hefty walking stick, both to use in case you become stuck, but also to tap the ground in front of you as you walk. A few seconds with a walking stick could be the difference between a messy wrestling match with a pool of quicksand and a safe hike.  ","1. If in quicksand, remove backpack or drop heavy items as your body density is less than quicksand.
2. If possible, remove shoes to avoid suction.
3. Take quick steps backward before quicksand takes hold, as it liquifies for a minute.
4. Sit and lean back if feet are stuck, creating a larger footprint to free them.
5. Move slowly and avoid big steps to prevent agitating quicksand.
6. Sit on a pole to prevent sinking, then inch sideways to firm ground.
7. Stay calm, breathe deeply, and avoid panic to maintain buoyancy.
8. Bend backward to spread out weight if sinking up to hips or higher.
9. Carry a walking stick to help navigate quicksand and prevent sinking.
10. Be cautious of unstable and wet ground with visible water seeping up, as quicksand can be easily identified.
11. Quicksand is common in tidal flats, swamps, marshes, near lake shores, and near underground springs.

Have them sit in a relaxed position with their legs uncrossed. Pay attention to see if they are in obvious distress or if they have something wrong with them that's visible to the naked eye., Sometimes, weight is included in vital signs. To weigh a patient, ask them to get on a scale, and then write down the number. Make no judgment on the person's weight, whether by comment, facial expression, or body language., For this vital, you'll need to ask the person how they are feeling and to rate their pain on a scale from 0-10. Of course, everyone's pain scale will be different, but if you can get a good idea of what level of pain the person is having, that helps assess their overall condition.First say, ""Are you in any pain?"" If the answer is ""yes,"" ask ""Can you rate your pain on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt?""  , Oxygen saturation is how much oxygen is in your blood. It is an important indicator of whether the patient is breathing properly and/or pumping blood to the body properly.

8," Learn the vowels., Identify consonant groups., Acquaint yourself with the nasal groups., Make sense of the Japanese ""Y"" group., Study the tail end groups of hiragana., Avoid particle confusion., Memorize hiragana symbols., Build your vocabulary through reading.",How to Learn to Read Japanese2," Five vowels form the basis of hiragana. These are: あ, い, う, え, and お (a, i, u, e, o). Almost all consonants in Japanese pair with these five vowels to make up consonant groups of five symbols. These groups often have voiced and unvoiced members, which will be further explained later.   An example of a consonant group is the ""K"" group. The consonant sound of this group combines with each vowel to make the five symbols: か (ka), き (ki), く (ku), け (ke), and こ (ko)., Groups are easier to remember because they're unvoiced (V-) symbols are only differentiated from voiced (V+) symbols by a quote-like mark (〃) or a small circle (゜). Voiced consonants in a group will make your throat vibrate, and unvoiced consonants will not.   V-: か, き, く, け, こ (ka, ki, ku, ke, ko) V+: が, ぎ, ぐ, げ, ご (ga, gi, gu, ge, go) V-: さ, し, す, せ, そ (sa, shi, su, se, so) V+: ざ, じ, ず, ぜ, ぞ (za, ji, zu, ze, zo) V-: た, ち, つ, て, と (ta, chi, tsu, te, to) V+: だ, ぢ, づ, で, ど (da, ji, zu, de, do) V-: は, ひ, ふ, へ, ほ (ha, hi, fu, he, ho) V+: ば, び, ぶ, べ, ぼ (ba, bi, bu, be, bo) V+: ぱ, ぴ, ぷ, ぷ, ぽ (pa, pi, pu, pe, po), A nasal is a sound like an ""m"" or an ""n."" These sounds vibrate in the top-back of your throat and into your nasal cavity. Japanese has two nasal groups in hiragana:   な, に, ぬ, ね, の (na, ni, nu, ne, no) ま, み, む, め, も (ma, mi, mu, me, mo), The ""Y"" group in Japanese can blend with consonant symbols that end in an い (i) sound (like き, じ, ひ / ki, ji, hi). This is represented by the consonant symbol followed by a small ""Y"" group symbol. The ""Y"" group has no unvoiced members.   The ""Y"" group: や, ゆ, よ (ya, yu, yo) Some common ""Y"" group blends: しゃ (sha), じゃ (ja), にゃ (nya), きゅ (kyu), ぎゅ (gyu), しゅ (shu), ひょ (hyo), びょ(byo), and しょ (sho)., Traditionally, the ""R"" group is taught last along with three unique symbols. Neither of these two end groups have unvoiced members. All ""r"" sounds should be pronounced similar to the ""t"" sound in ""water.""The ""R"" group: ら, り, る, れ,ろ (ra, ri, ru, re, ro) The unique three: わ, を, ん (wa, wo, n), Particles are a special part of Japanese grammar. There is no English equivalent, though it can help to think of particles like prepositions. Particles indicate the grammatical role words play in a sentence, and sometimes have a different pronunciation than you'd expect.   For instance, in the sentence, ""I go to school,"" the word ""I"" is the topic and ""school"" a destination, so it is written,「わたしはがっこにいきます」(watashi wa (I + topic particle) gakko ni (school + direction particle) ikimasu (go)). There are many particles in Japanese, but the most common include:  は (pronounced wa): topic marker. か (ka): indicates a question at the end of a sentence. が (ga): subject marker. に (ni): indicates location, movement, marks time and the indirect object. の (no): indicates the word before の is possessive of the word following it. へ (e): indicates direction (of movement). を (o): marks the direct object., The shape of hiragana symbols can be very foreign if you don't have experience writing in a similar Asian script. Practice regularly to improve your recall so that you can read these symbols quickly, fluently, and correctly.   You may want to make flash cards to help study. Write each symbol on one side of an index card and the pronunciation of the symbol on the opposite side., Many children's books and beginning learner Japanese materials are written solely in hiragana. By reading materials like these, you'll be sure to pick up some new vocab terms as you practice.You may want to make flash cards for new words, too. You can mix these in with your hiragana flash cards to add variety to your study.Some websites publish articles or simple stories in hiragana for beginning learners.

The weak muscles are usually most noticeable in the torso area. The child may also appear to have floppy limbs or a floppy body. The baby may also have a weak or soft cry.This is usually apparent at birth or right after birth. The floppiness or weakened muscles may get better or go away after a few months.; , Another common problem for children with PWS is feeding difficulties. The child may not be able to suck properly, so they will need assistance to feed. Because of the difficulties feeding, the child has slow growth development or a failure to grow.You may have to employ the use of feeding tubes or purchase special nipples to help the child suck properly. This generally causes a difficulty for the infant to thrive. These sucking problems may improve after a few months.  , As the child ages, they may experience rapid and excessive weight gain. This is generally due to problems with the pituitary gland and hormonal issues. The child may overeat, be hungry all the time, or have a food obsession, which adds to the weight gain.This generally occurs between ages one and six. The child may end up classified as obese.  , Another symptom of PWS is abnormal facial features. This includes almond shaped eyes, thin upper lips, narrowing at the temples, and a down turning of the mouth. The child may also have an upturned nose., Another developmental symptom of PWS is delayed development of the sexual organs. Often children with PWS have hypogonadism, which means they have underactive testicles or ovaries. This causes a reduced development of their genitalia.In females, they may have abnormally small vaginal lips and clitoris. In males, they may have a small scrotum or penis. They may have delayed or incomplete puberty. This also can lead to infertility.  , Children with PWS may display the signs of developmental delays. This may present as a minor or moderate intellectual disability, or the child may have learning disabilities. They may not do common physical developmental tasks until much later, such as sitting or walking.The child may test at an IQ of 50 to 70. Children may have difficulties with speech development.  , Reduced movement is a minor symptom of PWS. This may occur during pregnancy. The fetus may not have moved or kicked in the womb as much as normal. After the baby is born, he or she may display a lack of energy or extreme lethargy, which may be associated with a weak cry., If a child has PWS, they may have problems sleeping. They may be extremely sleepy during the day. They also may not sleep through the entire night, but experience disruptions while sleeping.The child may have sleep apnea.  , Children with Prader-Willi Syndrome may exhibit an array of behavior problems. They may throw excessive temper tantrums or be more stubborn than other kids. They may engage in lying or stealing, which is often related to food.The children may also show symptoms associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and even engage in actions like skin picking., There are a few physical symptoms that are minor criteria which help doctors diagnose PWS. Children with unusually fair, light, or pale hair, skin, or eyes are at a greater risk. Children may have crossed eyes or near-sightedness.The child may also show physical abnormalities, such as small or narrowed hands and feet. They also may be unusually short for their age.Children may have unusually thick or sticky saliva.  , Other less common symptoms may present in children with Prader-Willi Syndrome. This includes the inability to vomit and a high threshold for pain. They may have problems with their bones, such as scoliosis (a curvature of the spine) or osteoporosis (brittle bones).They may also have an early puberty because of abnormal activity in the adrenal glands.  , Doctors use the major and minor criteria to determine if Prader-Willi Syndrome is a possible condition for your child. Looking for these symptoms can help you determine if your child should be tested or examined by a doctor.For children two and under, a total of five points is needed to be tested. Three to four points must be from the major criteria symptoms, with the others coming from the minor symptoms. Children three and over must score at least eight points. Four to five points need to be from the major symptoms., One good way to get your child diagnosed for Prader-Willi Syndrome early is to take them to their scheduled check ups after they are born. The doctor can track their development and start to notice any problems.During any of the visits during your child’s early years, the doctor may use the symptoms noticed during the exam to diagnose PWS.In these appointments, the doctor checks the child’s growth, weight, muscle tone and movement, genitals, and head circumference. The doctor also routinely monitors the child's development. You should tell the doctor if your child has problems eating or sucking, if there are problems sleeping, or if they seem like they have less energy than they should. If your child is older, tell your doctor about any food obsessions or habits of overeating you notice in your child.  , If the doctor suspects PWS, they will perform a genetic blood test. This blood test will confirm that your child has PWS. The test will look for abnormalities on chromosome 15. If there is a history of PWS in your family, you can also get prenatal testing to check your baby for PWS.The genetic test can also help you figure out if you may have other children with the same condition.","The most important concepts from the provided data are:

   - **Prenatal Testing**: For families with a history of PWS to check for the condition in the fetus.

4. **Management and Treatment**:
   - **Feeding**: Assistance with feeding, possibly requiring feeding tubes or special nipples.
   - **Weight Management**: Dietary adjustments, physical therapy, and in severe cases, surgery.
   - **Behavioral Issues**: Psychological support, therapy, and sometimes medication.
   - **Sleep Apnea**: Treatment may include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines or surgery.
   - **Genetic Counseling**: For families with a history of PWS to understand the risks for future children.

5. **Prevention and Early Detection**:
   - **Regular Check-ups**: Early detection of developmental delays and other symptoms.
   - **Prenatal Testing**: For families with a history of PWS to screen for the condition in the unborn child.

Be prepared for any kind of response. It is also a good idea to talk with them when your schedule is relatively open, in case they want to head out shopping right away., If the person asks why you need a bra, you might want to talk about the activities that you are involved in that require a great deal of movement. This means that you are not only asking for a bra for personal reasons, but for health ones as well.   For example, you could tell them about how you play basketball and how you need more chest support as you are running around the court.  , If you’ve noticed that many of your friends have recently gotten bras, you might mention this as well. However, just be sure to reassure the person you’re asking that you are not giving in to peer pressure, you actually need a bra. But, putting everything into context as part of puberty may make this transition easier for all involved.   You might say, “All of my friends are currently wearing bras and, from talking with them, I think that it is a good time for me to start doing it as well.”  , This is a good way to break the ice too. Ask if they would like to go shopping with you and then head to a department store. Then, browse around the racks like usual, but make your way to the lingerie and undergarments section.Looking through the bra offerings of a large store can be a bit overwhelming, so before you go it is a good idea to hop online and browse through the various styles and sizes available.  , If this is the case, you may want to ask again after a few days have passed. Or, you can save up some money and see if you can purchase one on your own.Try to be conservative in what you ask for initially. Don’t request an elaborate or expensive push-up bra. Instead, keep your requests fairly minimal.  , If you are simply too nervous to talk, then compose a quick letter to your parent or guardian in which you ask them to help you select and purchase a bra. Keep the letter brief and to-the-point. State your request in a polite way and then explain your reasoning. Make sure to tell them whether you would prefer a written or verbal response.   For example, you might write, “I think I need a bra because my chest frequently hurts when we play sports in school. I think that I could use the additional support that a bra would provide.”  ","1.

By establishing the basic commands, your puppy can build a foundation for learning to play games and get along with other people and dogs. Actions such as sit, down, stay, & come can be extremely useful when you need to get your puppy's attention. Teaching them these things also helps to establish roles in the relationship.    Teach your dog to come.  Teach your dog to sit.  Teach your dog to lie down. After mastering basic commands, such as these, you can start practicing other tricks such as shake, rollover, and speak.  , When trying to let your puppy know that it is behaving appropriately or responding to a given command well, try using a reward method to get your message across to it. Reward your puppy with small treats that are given to them immediately following a good behavior or response to a command. Another form of reward is a gentle pat on the head or rub behind the ear while you say ""Good boy"" or ""Good girl"".   This attention and positive reinforcement lets your puppy know that when it behaves this way or responds to a command in this way, it will receive a reward. Be firm in your commands and strict with your treat disbursement. Don't just give the puppy treats at random times of the day or it won't learn that it has to work for its treats. Choose healthy treats that are specially formulated for puppies. Don't give it leftover dinner scraps that it may not be able to digest easily.  , Disciplining your puppy can be a tricky way of letting them know good from bad behavior. When using a discipline method to train your puppy, you need to discipline it each time it behaves badly, which can be hard to follow through with if you are not watching your puppy all of the time.   Although it may not be the best way to train and teach your puppy good behavior, some discipline methods include a light mist from a spray bottle, a quick and sudden noise like a hand clap, or a firm ""No"".

","The given data provides a series of strategies for dealing with siblings, offering advice on how to annoy, provoke, or manipulate them. The most important concepts from this data can be summarized as follows:

1. **Use Physical Responses**: The first piece of advice suggests using physical actions to annoy your sibling. By pulling their hair back, you aim to irritate them. Similarly, blocking their attack when they charge at you is meant to deter them. These tactics are about provoking a reaction from your sibling.

2. **Emotional Manipulation**: The suggestion to wake your sibling up early with a large pillow and keep throwing it at them, even if they are awake, is an example of emotional manipulation. This is done to annoy and potentially anger them.

3. **Social Engineering**: The data advises telling embarrassing stories about your sibling to their friends. This is a form of social engineering, where you manipulate the social dynamics by embarrassing your sibling in front of their peers. This strategy is especially effective if you have been on the receiving end of similar actions from your sibling.

4. **Retaliation and Vindication**: The overall approach of the data suggests a mindset of seeking revenge or vindication against your sibling. These strategies are not about resolving conflicts or improving sibling relationships but about asserting dominance or getting back at each other.

5. **Sibling Dynamics**: The advice is framed within the context of sibling rivalry and the complex dynamics between siblings. It highlights the competitive and sometimes adversarial nature of sibling relationships, where one sibling seeks to outdo or annoy the other.

6. **Emotional Impact**: The emphasis on causing annoyance, irritation, and potential anger suggests a focus on the emotional impact of these actions. The goal is not just to annoy but to elicit a strong emotional response from the sibling.

7. **Situational Responses**: The strategies are situational, suggesting that different tactics are appropriate in different situations (e.g., pulling hair back when they charge, waking them up with a pillow when they are asleep). This indicates a flexible approach to dealing with the whims and behaviors of siblings.

In summary, the data offers a collection of tactics aimed at annoying, irritating, and potentially angering one's sibling, framed within the context of sibling rivalry and the complex dynamics between siblings. These strategies are not about fostering harmony or mutual respect but about asserting dominance or seeking vindication.",1.3304661235929252e-155,0.08878504672897197,0.018779342723004695,0.06542056074766356,0.7786743640899658,0.8326958417892456,0.8047795295715332,0.11538461538461539

They will be able to provide with you guidance on whether or not this program is appropriate for you.   Start by talking to your doctor about your desire to lose weight by following the 20/20 diet. Bring in the book, recipes and allowed food lists so your doctor can familiarize himself with this eating plan. In general, the 20/20 diet can be viewed as a well-balanced diet; however, the initial phase (which is short in length) is fairly restrictive. Talk to your doctor specifically about this phase of the diet and whether he thinks it'd be safe for you. Ask your doctor whether or not he has additional guidance, advice or resources on safe and healthy weight loss for you.; , Like many diets, the 20/20 diet is fairly specific — especially in the initial phases. To help make your transition to this diet a little easier, write out your meal plan and a corresponding grocery list.Start by reviewing the allowed foods for whatever phase you're following. Also review the corresponding recipes that incorporate these allowed foods. To make your meal plan, take a calendar or date book and write in what you plan to eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner and any planned snacks. Do this for one week at a time. Review your meal plan and recipes and write up a corresponding grocery list. This will help keep you on track in the grocery store and prevent you from purchasing things you don't need.  , In addition to following a specific eating plan in the 20/20 diet, Dr. Phil also suggests setting up an exercise schedule. He gives some specifics in the diet to help support your weight loss.   The first thing to do is to get clearance from your doctor. The diet recommends this and it's a general safety practice you should always follow. You need to make sure exercise is safe and appropriate for you. Consider joining an exercise program at a gym, working with a personal trainer, buy some fitness DVDs or watch them for free online, or just start walking for 30 minutes every day. As you become more familiar with which exercises you enjoy, try to write out an exercise schedule for yourself week by week (you can ask a trainer to help you with this, too). It should be similar to your meal plan. Write out what type of exercise you want to do and for how long on each day of the week. In phase one, it's recommended to start by increasing your steps and overall endurance. This is especially important if you haven't been overly active previously.However, if you're already in fairly good shape, Dr. Phil recommends that you start the 30 second exercise plan, which is detailed in his book. This is where you do 30 second bursts of very high-intensity activity alternating with lower intensity exercises.  , In addition to the 20/20 book, there is also an app that you can download to your smartphone or tablet. This is an extra resource that may prove to be useful as well.   The 20/20 app is available for both iPhone and Android devices. It's free to install with both.The app provides a lot of the same information as the book; however, the sources are less robust as is the overall content. You can find information on each of the phases, lists of allowed foods and a variety of recipes on the app. The app also has information on performing the recommended exercises.  , To start off your weight loss on the 20/20 diet, you'll begin by entering phase one or the ""five day boost"" phase. The goal here is to help kick start your weight loss.The five day boost phase is the most restrictive part of the 20/20 diet. There is only a small list of foods that are allowed at this time. All are whole foods which are not processed and are naturally lower in carbohydrates. Start by gathering the list of foods that are allowed during this phase. They include: coconut oil, green tea, mustard, olive oil, almonds, apples, chickpeas, dried plums, prunes, leafy greens, lentils, peanut butter, pistachios, raisins, yogurt, eggs, cod, rye, tofu and whey powder. During this kick start phase, you'll need to eat four meals a day about four hours apart. Writing yourself a meal plan will help you stick to this schedule. If you purchase the 20/20 diet book, there are recipes provided for this specific phase.  , After you move through the five days of the boost phase, you'll enter phase two which is called the ""five day sustain"" phase. You'll continue your weight loss, but are now able to eat a wider variety of foods.In phase two, there are additional foods that you can eat; however, you need to continue with your current eating plan. Aim to have four meals a day about four hours apart. In addition to the approved 20 foods, you can also add: chicken breast, tuna, oats, brown rice, carrots, tomatoes, mushrooms, cashews, and blueberries. At each meal, you can add some of these new foods, however you still need to include two of the original 20 approved foods. This helps continue your weight loss. Another addition that you can do during this second phase is to incorporate two ""sensible splurges"" each week. These splurges need to be calorie controlled and total no more than 100 calories per splurge.  , Phase three or the 20 day attain phase is very similar to phase two. You do get to add in more foods and your main goal is to work towards attaining your goal weight.In this last weight loss phase of the 20/20 diet, you are able to add in even more foods. These include: avocado, raspberries, mushrooms, potatoes, spinach, quinoa, and black beans. They include more carbohydrate rich foods, but are still very nutritious and low in calories. Again, the eating plan doesn't change. You're to aim for four meals about four hours apart and can still include the two ""sensible splurges"" for 100 calories each.  , After the first three phases, you probably will have lost a significant amount of weight; however, to decide whether or not you should transition to maintenance, decide whether you want to continue with further weight loss.   The 20/20 diet recommends that you evaluate your weight after phase three comes to an end. Do you still want to lose more weight? Or are you content with your current weight loss? If you'd like to lose more weight, it's recommended that you restart from phase one and go through all three phases again. Repeat this sequence until you've hit your desired goal weight.If you're content with your weight loss, you can transition to phase four which focuses mostly on weight maintenance.  , The last and final phase of the 20/20 diet is the maintenance phase. This is the final phase and the habits and eating patterns you've adopted shouldn't change.   In order to prevent you from regaining the weight, the 20/20 diet recommends that you stay in phase three (with the occasional sensible splurge) long-term. You're encouraged to continue trying new recipes and monitoring your diet so that you stay on track with the four meals daily about four hours apart. Another important phase of maintenance is the continued work on your relationship with food and managing your desires to eat.  , When you've hit your goal weight after following the 20/20 diet, there are many lifestyle habits that you'll need to continue in order to maintain that weight. One of the is regular and consistent physical activity.   Research shows that one of the best ways to maintain a healthy weight or a weight loss is by including regular physical activity.The 20/20 diet in addition to most health professionals will recommend that you include at least 150 minutes of cardiovascular activity each week. Also include one to two days of strength training in addition to your cardio. For cardio, you can try: the 20/20 diet's high-intensity interval training program, running, walking, using the elliptical, hiking, dancing or taking a spin class. For resistance training, try: lifting weights or taking a yoga or pilates class.  , One place that many dieters slip up, is when they increase how much they snack or cheat during their maintenance phase. Too much of this behavior can cause weight regain.   The 20/20 diet specifically emphasizes that you should monitor your splurges and cheats. It allows you two sensible splurges long-term, so use those wisely and make sure you stay accountable to those two splurges.You may want to keep a food journal or diary during your maintenance phase. This can help you plan for and remember splurges so that you don't overdo it. If you do notice some weight regain, one of the first places you should evaluate is the amount of splurges you've been having.  , One unique aspect of the 20/20 diet is the emphasis on emotional eating and your relationship with food. It suggests continually monitoring this relationship and to work on controlling your cravings and desires to eat when you're feeling upset.The 20/20 diet says that your emotions play a big part in how much you eat and what you choose to eat. You need to continue to be aware of this so you don't fall back into old habits. The book associated with this particular diet gives a lot of great advice and tips on how to continually manage this aspect of your weight loss. For example, if you have a craving for junk food, try drinking a glass of water and going on a walk to help distract you from the craving. Or you could brush your teeth, which might keep you from indulging (and help support your oral health!).  , In addition to regular exercise and sticking to a sensible eating plan long-term, it's also recommended that you weigh yourself regularly and to track your weight long-term.   The 20/20 book and many health professionals note that when you weigh in regularly and keep track of your weight, you're more likely to continue losing weight and have a much better time maintaining your weight loss.Try to get on the scale one time per week, long-term. Weighing daily isn't necessary since day to day fluctuations in weight are common and don't necessarily reflect an accurate overall trend. If you notice your weight creeping up over time, revisit your exercise schedule and food journal to see what's causing your weight gain. You'll need to adjust what you're eating so your weight starts to go back down.  ","1. Consult a doctor before starting any diet, including the 20/20 diet.

20," Maximize your team's strength., Get in the right position., Take small steps backward., Push back with your legs as much as you can., Use teamwork., Keep practicing.",How to Win at Tug of War," You should put the strongest person in the back so that he can use his strength the most and will have the least chance of slipping. Some people say you should put the strongest person in front; the problem with that is that if this player slips up, you will lose your strongest player right off the bat. You can put the strongest person in the back while keeping one of the other strong players up front. In general, you should mix up your weakest and strongest players so you don't have a row of several weak players keeping you down.          If each end of your rope has a loop to place a player in, then your strongest player should go into the loop.; , First off, do not wrap the rope around your hands or wrists. This is guaranteed to harm you and possibly lead to a broken bone or a sprain. You should hold the rope with an underhand grip, keeping your arms as extended as you can so you can lean back most effectively. Remember that winning tug of war isn't about using your hands to pull the rope; it's about using your legs to push against the ground while holding onto the rope with your hands. If you plan to win just by pulling, you will get tired -- fast.          Keep your arms and body almost straight as you lean backwards with your upper body while planting your feet into the ground, using both of your legs as anchors. Pretend like you're sitting back into a seat that is very reclined. Your feet should be positioned a little wider than shoulder width apart. You and your teammates will all be positioned on one side of the rope, with your arms gripping the rope from both sides.  , Everyone should move in small baby steps so that both of the strongest muscles in the body (the thighs) can keep the rope on their side. If you take huge steps, you'll be much more likely to fall or trip. If you feel that your team is really beginning to dominate, you can do the power walk, by slowly walking backward sideways, with your chest facing the other side of the rope.         , Use all your leg muscles; arms should be locked out; don’t waste energy trying to pull with your arms or you will quickly run out of energy and will lose your grip. As you slowly walk backwards with your feet, rotate your shoulders backward slightly as you inch your arms and legs backwards. Make sure to always remain in the ""nearly falling"" seated position, and to never let your legs or body get behind your arms, so that you're scrunched up under the rope with your arms ahead of you. You won't be able to get any power from this position.         , Everyone should pull at the same time. This will generate the maximum amount of force that your team is supposedly capable of. Much like a dragon boat team, a good fluid and coordinated motion can easily propel ""the boat"", which in this case the opposing team forward.         , It may take a while for your team to find a winning rhythm. As you practice together more as a team, you will find the best coordination and the best order of team members that will lead to your success. Don't get frustrated right away; once you master the technique and the teamwork, you'll be well on your way to being tug-of-war champions!         ","1. **Strongest Person Positioning**: Place the strongest person at the back to maximize their strength and minimize the risk of slipping. Consider having one of the other strong players up front to balance the team.

2. **Mixing Strength Levels**: Blend the team's strength to avoid being held back by weaker players.

3. **Rope Handling**: Do not wrap the rope around hands or wrists; use an underhand grip and keep arms extended for effective leaning back.

4. **Leg Power**: Focus on using leg muscles for pulling, keeping arms locked out, and avoid pulling with the arms to conserve energy.

5. **Steady Movement**: Take small, controlled steps to maintain balance and avoid falls. The power walk can be used when the team is dominating.

6. **Coordination and Timing**: Ensure everyone pulls at the same time to generate maximum force. A coordinated, fluid motion is crucial for success.

7. **Practice and Teamwork**: Teamwork and practice are key to finding the winning rhythm and coordination. Patience is essential as the team improves.

8. **Safety First**: Avoid hand or wrist injuries by not wrapping the rope around hands.

9. **Straight Arm and Leg Positioning**: Keep arms and body almost straight while leaning back, with feet positioned wider than shoulder width apart, to effectively use legs as anchors.

10. **Prevent Injuries**: Do not use the rope to pull but to push against the ground using legs. This method is more effective and less prone to injuries.

11. **Positioning at Loops**: If rope ends have loops, place the strongest player in the loop for optimal positioning.

12. **Maintain Posture**: Maintain the ""nearly falling"" seated position to maximize power and efficiency in pulling.

13. **Focus on the Opposition**: Keep an eye on the opposing team's positioning and movements to exploit any weaknesses.

14. **Adapt to the Ground**: Adjust the team's positioning and grip based on the surface of the playing area to prevent slipping.

15. **Team Communication**: Maintain open communication to ensure everyone is pulling at the same time and to make adjustments based on the game's dynamics.

By focusing on these key concepts, teams can improve their strategy, technique, and overall performance in tug of war, increasing their chances of success.",1.694438785165414e-155,0.10606060606060605,0.03045685279187817,0.0707070707070707,0.785611093044281,0.8447805643081665,0.814122200012207,0.12355848434925867

If you know their schedule, you can adjust your own to avoid them. The key is to avoid becoming a hermit. Don't just stay in your home all the time. Weigh the pros and cons. Should I risk seeing other people? Is that risk so great that I should just stay at home all the time?   There are even apps that can help you avoid people. An app called Cloak collects geo-positioning data from other social medias like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter and then tells you if someone you are trying to avoid is nearby.It is not foolproof, but it can be a good tool especially if you're trying to avoid a person who uses social media a lot.  , Give them the silent treatment. If you are forced to interact with someone who hasn’t responded to your subtle or direct forms of communication, you might need to resort to more obvious, non-violent measures. The silent treatment isn’t just for children. This is a rather “toxic” maneuver because it is normally perceived as very obvious and rude. It is a quick way to tell people you aren’t interested in talking to them.   In many cases, this move can backfire. If you have a person who accepts no blame for their relationship with you, they may try to irritate you into talking. You’ll have to persevere or try something else., Violence is rarely the answer, unless you need to defend yourself. It can be very tempting to strike someone who is bothering you rather than stick to your non-violent methods. You'll want to slap or punch someone who is particularly insulting or annoying, but resist the urge. Use your words not your fists.  , If your relationship has escalated to harassment and even stalking, you might consider calling the police and filing a restraining order. Restraining orders should not be filed lightly. They can have serious legal repercussions for a person. So don’t file one unless you no longer feel safe around a person. If someone has physically assaulted you or made threatening remarks to you or your loved ones, consider a restraining order. ","1. **Adjusting Schedule to Avoid People**: If you know someone's schedule, you can adjust your own to avoid them. This involves planning your activities to coincide with their inactivity, thereby minimizing encounters.

2. **Apps for Avoiding People**: There are apps like Cloak that use geo-positioning data to alert you when someone you're trying to avoid is nearby. These tools can provide a level of control but are not foolproof.

3. **Silent Treatment**: If you must interact with someone who hasn't responded to your attempts to communicate, you might use the silent treatment as a non-violent way to signal disinterest. However, this can be risky, as it might provoke a reaction from the other person.

4. **Non-Violent Confrontation**: Violence is generally not an appropriate response to harassment or annoyance. It's important to use words to communicate your feelings and needs, rather than physical force.

5. **Seeking Legal Help for Harassment and Stalking**: If the situation escalates to harassment or stalking, involving the police and considering a restraining order can be necessary steps to ensure safety.

   - **Two Chisel-Like Shapes**: The description of these shapes as ""chisel-like"" indicates that they are elongated and tapered at one end, resembling the blade of a chisel. This suggests that these will be used for creating specific angles or detailing in the project.

3. **Fabric Pencil or Tailor's Chalk**: The tools mentioned are essential for this process. A fabric pencil is specifically designed for fabric and is less likely to break or smudge, making it ideal for tracing. Tailor's chalk is another common tool for this purpose, offering a bold line that is easy to see on fabric.

4. **Precision Cutting**: The goal of tracing the shapes is to achieve precise cuts. This is important for ensuring that the fabric pieces fit together correctly and for creating the desired shapes and angles.

5. **Variety of Shapes**: The inclusion of both a long rectangle piece and two chisel-like shapes suggests a project that requires versatility in cutting and possibly sewing techniques. The rectangle piece might be for a body panel, while the chisel-like shapes could be used for creating pockets, armholes, or other detailed elements.

In summary, the data outlines a method for creating three fabric cutouts through precise tracing of shapes, emphasizing the importance of using appropriate tools for accurate cutting and the variety of shapes needed for a specific project.",1.7267535131524172e-155,0.06832298136645963,0.0125,0.06211180124223602,0.7888862490653992,0.8614262342453003,0.8235620260238647,0.11061946902654868

The Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program supports the rehabilitation of historic structures of every age, size, shape and style. The goal of the program is to support rehabilitation of abandoned or underused schools, warehouses, factories, churches, retail stores, apartments, hotels, houses, and offices. The National Park Service (NPS) and the IRS administer the program in partnership with state historic-preservation offices.   The rehabilitation tax credit can reduce one's federal income tax by 20% of the amount spent in a certified rehabilitation of a certified historic structure. This is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in taxes. This program has been used to help preserve more than 40,000 historic properties in the U.S. since 1976. ; , The 20% tax credit is available only for the rehabilitation of historic and income-producing buildings that have been deemed certified historic structures by the National Park Service. The income-producing requirement generally precludes use of this credit for owner-occupied, residential properties. The credit is available to support rehabilitation of income-producing properties used for commercial, industrial, agricultural, or residential purposes. If a portion of a personal residence is used for business purposes, a homeowner may be able to apply for help with rehabilitation of that portion of the residence. ,   An owner can request a preliminary determination of historical significance from the National Park Service if the building is not yet listed on the National Register or located in a current historic district. This request can be made as part of the application for the tax-incentive program by completing Part 1 of the Historic Preservation Certification application. The application can be found on the National Park Service website. , In order for an owner to receive the 20% tax incentive, the National Park Service must approve the rehabilitation plans and certify the finished project. A certified rehabilitation means that the rehabilitation is consistent with the historic character of the property and/or the district in which the property is located.   NPS recognizes that buildings will be rehabilitated in a manner that allows for efficient commercial use. The rehabilitation must not destroy, damage or cover interior or exterior materials or features that give the building its historic significance., It is critical that you photograph all aspects of the interior and exterior of the building before you begin the project and again once the project is completed. These photographs are an important part of your application and necessary for your project to get final approval.  , Before you begin the rehabilitation you should contact your State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and discuss your proposed project. You can either download the Historic Preservation Certification application from the NPS website or request a copy from your SHPO. Review the application carefully, and submit it in the early stages of your project planning.You should not begin any rehabilitation until the project is formally approved in writing by NPS. The application has three parts: Part 1—Evaluation of Significance; Part 2—Description of Rehabilitation; Part 3—Request for Certification of Completed Work. You will submit the relevant parts of the application at different points in the rehabilitation process., The NPS requires that all applicants pay a fee. The fees are charged for the NPS review of the proposed project, as set forth in Part 2 of the application, and for review of the completed project, as set forth in Part 3 of the application. Fees vary and are based on the amount of rehabilitation planned.   You are not required to pay the fee until NPS requests payment. NPS will not issue its decision until you have paid your fees. You can access a fee schedule on the NPS website., In addition to the project requirements established by NPS, an applicant must also meet IRS requirements to be eligible for the 20% rehabilitation tax credit. These requirements include the following:   The building must be depreciable, which means that the building must be used in trade or for the production of income. The rehabilitation must be substantial, which means that during the two-year period of rehabilitation, the expenditures must exceed the greater of $5,000 or the adjusted basis of the building and its structural components. The property must be placed in service, which means that the building is presently being used for income-generation purposes. The expenditures must be considered qualified rehabilitation expenditures. These expenditures include the cost of work on the building, as well as fees for engineers and architects, site-survey fees, legal expenses, and other construction-related costs. Qualified rehabilitation expenditures do not include the building of a new addition or the provision of parking lots, sidewalks, landscaping or furnishings.  , Once you have received your NPS certification you can apply for your 20% tax credit from the IRS. You must complete IRS form 3468 for the tax year in which the rehabilitated building was put into service.   If you have not yet received your NPS certification, you must include Part 2 of the submitted application along with your tax filings. If NPS denies certification of the project, the tax credit will be disallowed. , In order to take full advantage of the IRS tax credit, you must maintain ownership of the building for at least five full years from the time the building was placed in service. If you sell the building within a year, you are responsible for repaying the entire tax credit. For properties held more than a year but less than five years, the tax credit is reduced by 20% for each year less than five you hold the property. , Generally only nonprofit organizations and public agencies are eligible to receive historic-preservation grants supported by the federal government or funded through the National Trust Preservation Fund. While you are able to register as an individual through the federal grant website, you would not be eligible to apply for historic-preservation grants.   If you are a nonprofit organization, a public agency, or a native-American tribal government, you would be eligible to apply for federal preservation grants. , In order to register with the federal grant website, you must first apply for a nine-digit Dun & Bradstreet identification number, known as ""DUNS."" You can apply for the number in the following ways:   You can call 1-866-705-5711 and register over the phone. You can register on the Dun & Bradstreet website.  , In addition to obtaining a DUNS number, you must also register your organization or agency with the System Award Management. You can register on the SAM website . You will be required to provide your organization’s name, the name of the organization’s authorized official, and the organization’s Employer Identification Number (EIN)., Once you have obtained your DUNS number and registered with SAM, you are able to register with Grants.gov. When you begin the registration process, you will be required to submit your DUNS number. Once this number has been verified, you will be able to create a username and password for your Grants.gov account.   The registration process is typically completed and approved in one day. You will be required to change your password every 60 days. , Once you are registered with Grants.gov, you can search the website for potential historical-preservation grants.The website allows you to search by keywords such as ""historic preservation"" and ""building."" This search should return open grants that can be used for the rehabilitation of historic buildings.   Once you have identified a list of possible grants, you can review the specific application requirements of each to see whether you are eligible. Typically the first page of each grant description provides you with an overview of the grant and a specification of who is eligible to apply. If you meet the eligibility requirements, and the grant provides funding for the type of rehabilitation you're proposing, finish applying for the grant.   , The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) funds a grant for public agencies or private, nonprofit organizations called the Challenge Grant. These grants are used to help organizations or agencies secure long-term funding for humanities programs and resources. While the grant is not specifically for historic preservation, under special circumstances the grant may be used to support construction and renovation projects.Challenge Grant eligibility and program requirements change, so it is important for you to review the requirements regularly to see whether your organization would qualify for funding. You can review the eligibility requirements on the NEH website by searching for “Challenge Grants.” , The NPS provides matching grants to states for the protection of historic properties. Some states work with nonprofit organizations or agencies to rehabilitate historic-preservation sites. If you are interested in applying for a National Park Service grant, you should contact your SHPO and see whether it works with organizations like yours on rehabilitation projects.   You should also search for NPS grants on the Grants.gov website and see whether your project meets the eligibility requirements for grants. You can find a list of State Historic Preservation Offices on the National Park Service website., The NTPF allows members who are public agencies or nonprofit organizations to apply for NTPF grants that can be used for limited historic-preservation projects. All applicants must match NTPF grant funds dollar-for-dollar, and the funds cannot be used for construction. They can be used to hire a preservation architect, a landscape architect, a preservation planner, or a real estate development consultant. You can review the specific application requirements and apply for a grant on the NTPF website.

Common benefits include Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, and other benefits. If they do, then you’ll need to create an estate plan that doesn’t cause your heir to lose those benefit.   Fortunately, you can create a “third-party settled special needs trust.” You fund this trust with cash or assets. Because the assets aren’t owned in your heir’s name, the government won’t consider them when determining your heir’s eligibility for government benefits.If you leave money directly in a will, then you may disqualify the heir. For this reason, you should proceed cautiously and create an appropriate trust.; , Your heir can also fund their own trust, called a “self-settled special needs trust.”You should investigate what kinds of assets they already have available.   For example, a disabled person might have won a sum of money in a lawsuit. Alternately, another family member might have left them assets. If they set up a proper trust with their assets, they can still qualify for government benefits. However, government benefits may have to be repaid with assets left over in the trust after their death., Most people have most of their wealth in retirement accounts. You should have named beneficiaries to receive your benefits after your death. Check whether you named the disabled heir as a beneficiary.   If you named your disabled heir, then the government will count those assets when determining if your heir is eligible for government benefits.You can avoid this problem by naming the special needs trust as the beneficiary. However, leaving retirement benefits to a special needs trust has negative tax consequences. You should talk this over with a lawyer. Instead, you might want to leave retirement benefits to your other heirs and fund the special needs trust with other assets., You can also leave life insurance proceeds to a special needs trust. Ideally, you will have permanent (not term) life insurance. Permanent life insurance can provide for your disabled heir regardless of when you die.Some insurers, such as Merrill Lynch and MetLife, have create divisions to help clients plan for a disabled heir.Choose an insurer with experience helping families with special needs children and get expert help. Think carefully about who to insure. If one parent stays home to care for a disabled child and the other works, you might want to insure the caregiver so that you can afford to pay someone else to care for your child. If you already have life insurance, then review the beneficiary designations on the policy. You don’t want to leave life insurance proceeds directly to the disabled heir if they receive government benefits.  , Begin by estimating their likely life expectancy. Then calculate how much it costs each year for medical care, housing, personal attendants, etc. You should have some of this information already at hand.   Remember to deduct the amount of government benefits they will continue to receive in the future., A qualified estate planning lawyer can review your situation and provide tailored advice. You should schedule a consultation and meet to discuss the best course to take.   You can get a referral to a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association.Ask for a trust and estates attorney, preferably one who has handled planning for disabled heirs. Planning for disabled heirs has its own unique wrinkles, and you’ll want a lawyer who has extensive experience in this area.Call up the lawyer and schedule a meeting. Ask how much the lawyer charges. Talk with the lawyer about whether your disabled heir will need to be at the meeting.  , Your lawyer will want to know how you will fund the special needs trust. You probably will need to complete detailed paperwork before showing up to your consultation. You may also need to bring copies of your retirement account and life insurance policies. Ask ahead of time what you will need.  , Pooled trusts are special needs trusts. However, they are usually run by nonprofits.You won’t have to name a trustee because the nonprofit will name one. Pooled trusts are helpful if you don’t know who to name as a trustee or if you aren’t leaving much money.   Pooled trusts aren’t available everywhere. Talk to your lawyer about whether this is an option and where you can find more information.  , You will transfer assets to the trust, which means they are no longer yours. Your disabled heir will be the “beneficiary” of the trust. You’ll also need to name someone as the “trustee,” who oversees the trust. The trustee invests the assets and disburses money for the beneficiary’s benefit.Talk with your lawyer about who would be a good trustee. Generally, you will want to name someone who is familiar with your disabled heir’s needs.For example, a sibling might be a good choice. A trustee should also be financially responsible, although they do not need to be a financial expert. You can name successor trustees in case your first choice declines, dies, or chooses to stop acting as trustee.  , If you left assets directly to a disabled heir in your will, you may need to revise it. You don’t want these assets to pass to them in probate after you die, since the assets may disqualify the person for government benefits.   Show your lawyer a copy of your current will. You may need to draft an amendment or revoke the old will and draft an entirely new one.  , Since you’re meeting with the lawyer about the special needs trust, you should tackle related issues at the same time. For example, talk about the following with your lawyer:   Your own death or incapacity. For example, you might want to create a durable medical power of attorney in case you become incapacitated. You can also create a durable financial power of attorney so that someone can manage your finances when you no longer can.How you will provide for your other heirs. For example, you might want to create a will at the same time you create the special needs trust. Alternately, you could create a separate trust for your other heirs. Whether you should write a nonbinding statement of wishes. Immediately after you die, it will take a little bit of time for a special needs trust to go into effect. During this period, you’ll want to provide for your disabled heir. Your letter can explain who should take care of the heir until a guardian can be named, as well as what medications they should take and where they should stay., If your child is a minor, you can name a guardian. This person will take care of your child once you die. Check your will to see if you have named someone. If not, your lawyer can help you.  , Once a child reaches adulthood, they generally are allowed to take care of themselves unless a court appoints a guardian to make decisions for them. Discuss with your lawyer about being named your disabled child’s guardian.   Also talk about what will happen when you die. Identify how you will provide for a successor guardian of an adult disabled child. You may have to update your will or take some other step as allowed by state law.If you name a successor guardian, be sure to talk to them ahead of time. It is a heavy responsibility for someone, and you only want to name someone who is serious about serving. You will also need to begin talking about the care your disabled child receives.  , You should set up a filing cabinet or a folder and collect important information. Remember that a future guardian is not as intimately familiar with your disabled child’s needs as you are. Put the following in the folder:Personal information. Include birth certificates, insurance policies, and social security cards. Emergency contacts. Include the name and information for the person who will care for your child immediately after your death or incapacity. If your child is in school, add the name of any guidance counselors. Medical history information. Include the name of your child’s primary physician and specialists. Also include information on medications, allergies, family medical history, insurance company policy numbers, and Medicaid information. Legal information. Include the name and contact information for your lawyer and the trustee. Financial information. Keep a copy of your estate plan and information on your child’s representative payee accounts. If you use online banking, then include account information and passwords. Your statement or letter of intent. Your personal information. Since you are creating a folder for a disabled child, you might as well create one for yourself at the same time in case you become incapacitated. Include your personal information (birth certificate, marriage certificate etc.) and financial information.  ","The most important concepts from the provided data are:

1. **Special Needs Trusts**: These are crucial for disabled individuals receiving government benefits, as they allow for the transfer of assets without disqualifying the beneficiary from government benefits. There are two types:
   - **Third-Party Settled Special Needs Trust**: Funds this trust with cash or assets owned by the individual, which the government does not consider when determining the beneficiary's eligibility for government benefits.
   - **Self-Settled Special Needs Trust**: Funds the trust with assets owned by the beneficiary themselves, which may require repaying government benefits with assets left over after their death.

2. **Retirement Accounts and Beneficiary Designations**: Ensure that retirement benefits are not left directly to the disabled heir to avoid disqualification of government benefits. Instead, name the special needs trust as the beneficiary.

3. **Life Insurance**: Consider permanent life insurance to provide for a disabled heir regardless of when you die. Some insurers specialize in helping families with special needs children.

4. **Estate Planning Lawyer**: Consult with a specialized estate planning lawyer to tailor advice for the unique needs of a disabled heir. Schedule a consultation and gather necessary documents for the meeting.

5. **Pooled Trusts**: Nonprofit trusts that can be a good option for those unsure of who to name as a trustee or for those not leaving much money. They are available in some areas and are a way to manage assets without naming a trustee.

6. **Asset Transfer to the Trust**: Transferring assets to the trust means they are no longer yours, and the disabled heir becomes the beneficiary. A trustee oversees the investment and disbursement of funds for the beneficiary's benefit.

7. **Revising Will**: If assets are left directly to a disabled heir, they may need to be revised to avoid probate after your death, which could disqualify them from government benefits.

8. **Power of Attorney and Guardianship**: Consider creating durable medical and financial powers of attorney for yourself in case of incapacity, and discuss naming a guardian for your child. Identify a successor guardian for an adult disabled child.

9. **Important Documents and Information Collection**: Keep important documents and information in a folder or filing cabinet for the disabled child and yourself, including personal information, emergency contacts, medical history, legal and financial information, and a statement or letter of intent.

10. **Statement of Intent**: Prepare a letter explaining care arrangements, medications, and living arrangements for the disabled child immediately after your death or incapacity. This document is crucial for ensuring continuity of care.",2.1901072670833767e-155,0.18875502008032127,0.04435483870967742,0.12048192771084336,0.7996006608009338,0.8361020684242249,0.8174440860748291,0.16964285714285715

This will be a holy shrine dedicated to the Wiccan God and Goddess.; , There are many beautiful altar cloths that you can purchase from Wiccan supply stores. Some have symbols of the God and Goddess, others portray Celtic symbols. You may just want to use a plain color cloth or you can choose not to cover the shrine at all. This is strictly a matter of personal taste.  , This symbol can be anything from a white candle to symbolize the Goddess or a yellow candle to symbolize the God to an ornate statue to portray the Wiccan deities. Use something that is meaningful to you. If you live in a home with other non-Wiccans, you might not want to be so bold as to use blatant pagan symbols. In this case, a corresponding candle may be the best choice to represent the Wiccan God and Goddess.  , When you are ready to pray or give an offering, the incense can be lit to help promote a more spiritual state of mind or to consecrate an item before offering. The censer can be anything from a seashell to a bowl of sand or even an elaborate pagan censer if you wish.  , You can use anything you wish for this from a small saucer to a seashell or piece of pottery. Whatever you choose for this purpose, use it only for offerings. It will become a holy thing and shouldn't be used for other reasons if you can help it.  , Light the incense and sprinkle it with water and salt, while asking the elements and the God and Goddess to bless and consecrate the space.

30," See your doctor., Consent to an ultrasound., Consent to laparoscopic surgery., Take all medications as directed., Notify your sexual partners.",How to Recognize Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)2," As soon as you suspect PID, make an appointment to talk with your OBGYN. They will ask you about your medical and sexual history and then will do a general pelvic exam. If they find that you are tender in your abdomen and around your cervix, then they will likely order additional testing. If your OBGYN is booked up, try contacting your primary care physician. You could also go to a clinic, such as Planned Parenthood.They may order a blood test to see if your cells appear to be fighting off an infection. They may also send off a cervical fluid sample to be tested for STDs.There is no one clear way to diagnose PID. That means that, unfortunately, it is often misdiagnosed as another problem with similar symptoms, such as appendicitis. Your doctor may also recommend hospitalization as part of your treatment if you: are very ill, won’t respond to antibiotics, have an abscess, or are pregnant.  , If your doctor believes that a PID diagnosis is possible, but needs more evidence they may request permission to complete an ultrasound, or in-depth image of your body’s interior. For example, an ultrasound can show whether or not an abscess is blocking or stretching out part of your fallopian tubes, something that is not only painful but very dangerous to your overall health., This is a procedure where your doctor will make a small incision in your abdominal area and then insert a small, lighted camera. This will allow them to view your internal organs up close and personal. They can also take tissue samples, if needed, to conduct additional testing.Even though it is only minimally invasive, a laparoscopic procedure is still surgery. So, you’ll want to be very clear on the possible risks and benefits before agreeing to go forward.  , The most common treatment for PID is antibiotics. Because PID infections are usually quite severe and may involve a number of different harmful organisms, you’ll probably have to take at least two different types of antibiotics at once. They will come in either pill form or an in-office shot.If you get pills, make sure to read the directions carefully and finish the entire run of the drugs, even if you start to feel better before they are finished. Most doctors will want you to make a follow-up appointment about three days in so they can check your progress.  , While PID is not contagious, the STDs that it often develops from, chlamydia and gonorrhea, are easily passed between sexual partners. This makes it possible for you to be cured of PID only to be infected once more. Once you’ve been diagnosed with PID, talk with your sexual partner(s) and suggest that they seek out treatment. Remember that they may show no symptoms, but still have PID and be capable of spreading it.","1. Suspect PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease) and seek medical attention as soon as possible.

33," Seek out positive, supportive relationships., Set personal boundaries., Speak up for yourself when you are scapegoated., Get distance from toxic people.",How to Stop Being an Easy Target/Scapegoat3," You can counteract the negative impact of being a scapegoat by cultivating healthy relationships. Plus, when you spend time around people who treat you fairly, you will stop accepting anything less.Identify the relationships in your life in which you feel valued, encouraged, and supported. Make an effort to enrich these relationships by showing appreciation for these people and dedicating more of your time to them. Make new friendships through support groups, professional organizations, or interest groups in your community. Lean towards people who appear emotionally healthy and don’t blame you for their problems.  , Boundaries are the limitations where one person ends and another begins. In scapegoating relationships, these lines are all blurred. Stop allowing yourself to be scapegoated by setting firm boundaries.For instance, you might say to your business partner, “I will no longer tolerate being treated this way. If you want to continue having me as a partner, you will need to stop blaming me for the business failing.”  , When your boundaries are violated and others try to put you back in the scapegoat role, speak out. Show them that you are unwilling to be the scapegoat by reasserting your boundaries.You might say to your scapegoating sibling, “No, I will not pay for your court fees. I told you that I will not be held responsible for your financial troubles.”  , If others refuses to respect your boundaries, you may have to make the tough choice to cut ties. Decide whether it is best to minimize contact or cut contact completely with the offenders.Estrangement is a painful reality, but it may be necessary to help yourself get unstuck from the role of scapegoat. If the scapegoating happens in your family, you might cut ties. If it’s happening at your job, you might try to switch departments or transfer to a new employer. Work with your therapist to decide the best route for handling family members, partners or close friends who insist on blaming you.  ","From the provided data, the key concepts revolve around overcoming the negative impact of being a scapegoat, cultivating healthy relationships, setting boundaries, and addressing scapegoating situations. Here are the most important concepts:

1. **Overcoming Scapegoat Impact**: The data emphasizes that being a scapegoat can have negative effects on one's mental and emotional well-being. To counteract these effects, one must focus on building healthy relationships and cultivating positive social connections.

2. **Cultivating Healthy Relationships**: The importance of surrounding oneself with people who treat them fairly and value them is highlighted. This involves identifying and nurturing relationships where one feels valued, encouraged, and supported.

3. **Setting Firm Boundaries**: Boundaries are crucial in distinguishing personal limits from those of others. In scapegoating relationships, where lines are often blurred, setting firm boundaries is essential to prevent being used as a scapegoat.

4. **Speaking Out and Reasserting Boundaries**: When boundaries are violated and attempts are made to re-establish the scapegoat role, it's important to speak out and reassert one's boundaries. This communication is key to not only defending one's boundaries but also to others understanding the seriousness of the issue.

5. **Choosing Severance**: In cases where boundaries are not respected, the data suggests that cutting ties may be necessary. This can involve minimizing contact or completely cutting off ties with those who continue to scapegoat the individual. Estrangement, while painful, is sometimes necessary for personal well-being.

6. **Professional and Community Support**: Engaging in support groups, professional organizations, or interest groups can provide opportunities to form new friendships and connections with emotionally healthy individuals who do not blame others for their problems. This can be a supportive step towards breaking the cycle of scapegoating.

7. **Consulting with a Therapist**: Working with a therapist can be beneficial in navigating the complexities of scapegoating situations, especially when dealing with family members, partners, or close friends. Therapists can provide strategies and guidance on how to handle these situations effectively and work towards healing and personal growth.

In summary, the data outlines a comprehensive approach to overcoming the negative effects of being a scapegoat, focusing on building healthy relationships, setting and enforcing boundaries, and addressing scapegoating situations through communication and, if necessary, severance.",6.78900576249663e-232,0.07161125319693096,0.005141388174807198,0.04603580562659847,0.7903231382369995,0.8508362770080566,0.8194640874862671,0.09963768115942032
34," Decide on a game., Learn the script., Learn how to use the above commands., Start scripting your game., Work on the instructions page., Work on the contents of the game itself., Create a winning screen., Your game should now look like the code above:   Run the program and make sure it works.  , Touch up your file., Correct grammar where appropriate., Create graphics for the game if you would like., Correct any typing errors that you can find., Congratulations, you have just created a basic computer game with batch script!  ",How to Build a Simple Computer Game Using Batch Script," Before deciding to make a shoot-em-up game or point-and-click game, know that even with MS DOS 8, batch script has serious limitations to its capabilities. You will not be able to create more of a game than a text-based game. It can be a quiz or a scenario game, but you will have only text. As to whether or not you want to have ASCII graphics is up to you, but the game will still be based entirely on text input.; , The script is not that hard to learn, you may even learn it simply by looking at a program. To know any scripting language you may need to know some basic commands in your computer's command line. For this command line, the basic commands that you will need are:   echo color title goto if set labeling (not a command, but how to label)  ,   The echo command is used to print out text to the console. Below, the echo command prints out ""Hello, world!"":       The color command is used to change the color of the text in the command line. This isn't very useful, and probably shouldn't be focused on until you have finished the game itself, but the results of the color change can be quite appealing. Colors in DOS command lines are numbered, there is a table of the colors at the end of this article. The following command will change the text color to black background with green text:       The title command simply changes the name of the window on the title bar and task bar, and is by no means useful, however, it can make your program look professional. Using it like so will change the title of the window to ""Fun Program"":       The goto command is used to go to a certain part of the program. You will be using it to determine what will happen when certain answers are chosen from questions. To use the goto command to go to a label called ""WRONG"":       The if command is used to determine what will happen if a certain event occurs. After the if statement (if ), a command follows. At the if statement, if a certain event is true, the command in the statement will be carried out. You will be using this statement to determine which goto command is to be used. This if statement will be true if the input is equal to 12:       The set command is actually quite complicated, since it may be used in many ways. As for now, all you need it for is to get the computer to receive input. To do this:       Finally, labeling. Labeling can name certain parts of the program so that you may use the goto command. You can name certain sections of the program anything, so long as the name isn't a command. To label a section ""main"", type the following:    :MAIN      Labeled sections include the label itself and all code that follow it until another label is present or the file reaches the end! Make sure you place the label before the section being labeled, and another label following it so that the computer understands what section is labeled! Example below:    @echo off :LABEL1 echo THIS IS A TEST OF TEXT set/p input=THIS IS A TEST INPUT_ if %input%==1 goto LABEL1 goto LABEL2 :LABEL2 echo TEST      The first line of the above program may have been confusing to you. This line turns off the display of the code inside the file, so it doesn't look like it was all typed out on a console. As of now that is unimportant, right now you should be determining what the above program will do(ignore the first line). The program will display text saying ""THIS IS A TEST OF TEXT"", then it will prompt for input. If the input is ""1""(meaning you typed in 1), the program will return to LABEL1 and the commands below it will repeat. If the condition in the if statement is not met, the computer will print text to the console ""TEST"". Copy the above program into two different windows running notepad. In one, save it as TEST1 in any folder and run it. Notice how the text is displayed. In the second window, erase the first line and save it as TEST2 and run it. Notice the difference?   Once you have a general understanding of how the above commands may be used, you may move on to the next step.  , It is suggested that a beginner use notepad, but if you would like to use MS DOS EDIT, that's fine, too. It is also suggested to a beginner to begin with a basic quiz game, so this is what this article will show you how to do. Remember to start by turning off the echo. Then introduce your game with some text through the echo command, then use set to allow input with the goto command. This may sound confusing, so look above (Note: the command REM creates comments, i.e. notes for the developer that won't show in the final result):  , At this point, you should save your file(save as something.bat), and put it in a folder that you created for the game. After saving it, run it and make sure it works.   From this point on you will be having multiple files per game (especially if you want to have ASCII graphics). You can get the batch script to print out the contents of any file on the screen with the type command. The below will print the contents of TEST.txt:       It's important to remember to include the file extension, or the command may not work properly.   Create an instructions page in notepad. It should say something like:       Save this as INST.txt in the folder of the batch file, then make it so that your game will print the text to the console on the instructions page:       Run the program and make sure it works.        , This is where most of your creativity/research, work, and time is spent working on the game, as well as where most of the game's scripting should be. There should be a place that you go when you get an answer wrong, and a way to advance to the next question when you get the answer right. The above will have basic questions about the exterior of a car. You may replace them with what you like.   Run the program and make sure it works.  , Creating a winning screen is as simple as the instructions screen. Create a text document with praise for winning and save it as WIN.txt in the batch folder. Add the following lines to the end of your game for the winning screen:  ,, Start by going to each label and placing the cls command after it. This will clear the screen at each label so you don't have a screen full of unnecessary information.  , If you want, make all of the answers on the list complete sentences. NOTE THAT YOU SHOULD AVOID CONTRACTIONS IN THE BATCH SCRIPT ECHO COMMAND! You should also avoid slashes and greater than/less than symbols, stars, percent symbols, and any other unusual symbols. These symbols will create a syntax error that causes the program to stop, lag, or crash.  , Generate ASCII art in separate text documents and use the type command to display them in the program:  , Think of your own things to correct. Then add your color with the color command. It is suggested that you place it at the beginning of the program so that the whole program is of this color. Here is the explanation of how to use it directly from the command line:  Sets the default console foreground and background colors.  COLOR attr Specifies color attribute of console output  Color attributes are specified by TWO hex digits -- the first corresponds to the background; the second the foreground. Each digit can be any of the following values:  0 = Black 8 = Gray 1 = Blue 9 = Light Blue 2 = Green A = Light Green 3 = Aqua B = Light Aqua 4 = Red C = Light Red 5 = Purple D = Light Purple 6 = Yellow E = Light Yellow 7 = White F = Bright White  If no argument is given, this command restores the color to what it was when CMD.EXE started. This value either comes from the current console window, the /T command line switch or from the Default Color registry value.   In other words, if you wanted a bright white background and black text:    @echo off color f0 :MAIN cls echo.       ,","1. **Limitations of MS DOS 8 and Batch Script for Game Development**: With MS DOS 8, batch scripts have limited capabilities for creating more than a text-based game. They can be quizzes or scenario games, but the game will be based entirely on text input.

2. **Basic Commands in DOS Command Line**: The basic commands that are needed are:
   - `echo` - prints out text to the console.
   - `color` - changes the color of the text in the command line.
   - `title` - changes the name of the window on the title bar and task bar.
   - `goto` - goes to a certain part of the program.
   - `if` - determines what will happen if a certain event occurs.
   - `set` - gets the computer to receive input.
   - `labeling` - names certain parts of the program for use with the `goto` command.

3. **Creating a Basic Quiz Game**: Beginners are suggested to start with a basic quiz game. The game should start with some text, allow input with the `set` and `goto` commands, and have a place for wrong answers and correct answers.

4. **Printing the Contents of a File**: The `type` command can be used to print the contents of any file on the screen. Ensure to include the file extension for the command to work properly.

5. **Instructions Page**: Create a text document for instructions and add it to the game so that it prints to the console.

6. **Winning Screen**: Create a text document for the winning screen and add it to the game.

7. **Clearing the Screen**: Use the `cls` command after each label to clear the screen.

8. **ASCII Art**: Generate ASCII art in separate text documents and use the `type` command to display them in the program.

9. **Color Command**: Use the `color` command to change the color of the text and background. Ensure to place it at the beginning of the program for the whole program to be of the specified color.

10. **Avoiding Syntax Errors**: Avoid using unusual symbols, such as slashes, stars, percent symbols, and any other symbols that can cause the program to stop, lag, or crash.

11. **Recommended Software**: Use Notepad for beginners, but MS DOS EDIT is also an option.",6.828216052237831e-79,0.24,0.07589285714285714,0.13333333333333333,0.7914650440216064,0.8229361176490784,0.8068938851356506,0.2151095186983859

Strategies to reduce the dust and dust mites in your home include:   Purchase a HEPA air filter. This can help to clear dust out of the air, and hence reduce your allergy symptoms. Wash your bedding at least once a week in hot water. This can help to prevent the accumulation of dust and dust mites. Also use allergy-proof covers on your mattress and pillow covers to reduce the accumulation of dust and dust mites. Vacuum any carpets in the home at least twice a week, and clean any surfaces that gather dust regularly. Use a wet paper towel or sponge to clean these surfaces — a duster will just cause the dust to recirculate and settle again.; , Mold grows in damp places, such as around leaks in roofs or pipes, in the shower or bathroom, or anywhere with moisture. Strategies to reduce your exposure to mold include:   Throw out any shower curtains, carpets, or other things in your home that have mold on them. If you spot mold on something, your best bet is just to get rid of it. The longer it lingers in your home, the more of a chance there is for mold spores to get into the air and to worsen your allergy symptoms. Use a dehumidifier to reduce the humidity in your home to less than 50%. Because mold thrives with greater moisture and humidity, this can help to prevent mold problems from developing in your home.  , If you have severe pet allergies, consider getting a non-hairy pet instead such as a fish or lizard. If you only have mild pet allergies and are seeking to manage them as best as possible, you can try:   Washing your pet at least once a week. This is because, contrary to popular belief, pet hair is not the most common allergen; rather, it is pet dander (dead skin cells that naturally shed from your pet). For this reason, bathing your pet can help to diminish the dander and reduce your allergy symptoms. Keeping your pet out of the bedroom. Because you spend quite a bit of time in the bedroom every night, as well as the fact that bedrooms are often carpeted, keeping your pet out can prevent pet dander from accumulating in your bedroom. This, in turn, can help to alleviate your allergy symptoms.  , These include:   Getting an artificial Christmas tree because real trees have the potential to grow mold. Some people are also allergic to the fragrance of a real tree. If you do get a real tree, consider washing it thoroughly with water outdoors before you bring it in and decorate it. If you are visiting relatives for the holidays who have a pet (and you are allergic), plan appropriately by asking for a room as far away as possible from the pet, and by bringing allergy medications as needed. Be aware of the rebound effect if you are not spending the holidays with your own pet. Some people, after being away from their pet for several days, return home only to find that their allergy to their own pet has worsened. This is due to a decreased tolerance in your immune system following your absence. Understand that stress can trigger allergy symptoms such as hives or asthma. Try to stay as relaxed as possible over the holidays, and take steps to lighten your workload during the holidays (such as preparing some of the dishes for big dinners in advance).  , Some people confuse the runny nose they get from being outside in the cold with a winter allergy when, in fact, the two are not related. A runny nose in the cold is a vasomotor (physiological) response; it may be correlated to changes in temperature (particularly the cold), windy weather, changes in humidity, and strong odors or smoke.  ","The most important concepts from the given data are:

1. **Prevention and Minimization of Allergen Exposure**: The best way to combat allergy symptoms is to prevent or minimize exposure to allergens. This involves strategies such as using a HEPA air filter, washing bedding regularly, vacuuming carpets, and cleaning surfaces to reduce dust and dust mites.

2. **Mold Prevention**: Mold thrives in damp places, so reducing moisture and humidity in your home is crucial. This includes using a dehumidifier, getting rid of mold-infested items, and keeping humidity levels below 50%.

3. **Pet Allergy Management**: For severe pet allergy sufferers, consider getting a non-hairy pet. For those with mild allergies, washing pets regularly and keeping them out of the bedroom can help manage symptoms. Additionally, planning for holiday visits with pet-owning relatives and being aware of the rebound effect after being away from pets can also be beneficial.

4. **Distinguishing Between Seasonal and Allergic Symptoms**: It's important to differentiate between a runny nose caused by cold weather or changes in temperature and humidity, and a true allergic reaction. Understanding the physiological response to cold weather (vasomotor rhinitis) is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management of symptoms.

5. **Stress Management**: Stress can trigger allergy symptoms such as hives or asthma. Taking steps to reduce stress, such as staying relaxed and managing workload during the holidays, can help alleviate allergy symptoms.

These concepts highlight the importance of proactive measures in managing allergy symptoms, emphasizing prevention, environmental control, and lifestyle adjustments.",1.0862012799996282e-78,0.34895833333333337,0.07853403141361257,0.16145833333333334,0.8287822008132935,0.8623225688934326,0.8452197313308716,0.22172293778355098

When choosing tulle or organza, go for a very soft, pale color, or white. When choosing cellophane, go for something iridescent, as it will reflect the light better. You can also use teddy bear stuffing and pieces of moss instead.  , Purchase a small fairy figurine, and glue her to the inside of the jar lid using hot glue or super glue. Screw the lid back onto the jar, and turn the jar upside down. The lid will now be the bottom of the jar, making it a sort of snow globe.   Consider gluing gown bits of moss, stones, and tiny flowers to the lid around the fairy. This will hide the bottom of the lid, and give the fairy a pretty home to live in. If you cannot find a fairy figurine, you can make your own by purchasing a person-shaped figurine, and gluing craft butterfly wings to the back.  , You can make your fairy jar more colorful by painting the lid.

Don't paint the sides with glue just yet. Pour some glitter onto the lid. Gently lift the lid off your work surface and tap the glitter off. Wait for the glue and glitter to dry before applying glue and glitter to the sides.   Consider working over a sheet of paper. When you are done, fold the paper in half, and use it to funnel the excess glitter back into its container. Consider sealing the glitter so that it doesn't shed. Wait for the glue and glitter to dry, then apply a thin, even coat of clear, glossy spray paint. Wait for the coat to dry completely before applying a second one.  , Place the lid on top of some pretty fabric. Trace a circle around the lid—make the circle about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) larger than the lid. Cut the circle out of the fabric and screw the lid onto the jar. Place the fabric circle on top of the lid and push the edges down around the sides of the lid. Wrap a piece of ribbon or twine around the neck of the jar, holding the fabric in place. Tie the ribbon or twine into a pretty bow.  , Take a few colorful gemstones or rhinestones, and glue them onto the lid using hot glue or tacky glue. You can also glue beads, buttons, pretty rocks, or even a figurine to the top of the jar.  , You can also decorate the ribbon by gluing a flower or rhinestone in the middle of the bow.  , Tinted mason jars come in different colors, including blue, green, and purple. They can help lend a more unique look to your fairy jar. If you cannot find a tinted mason jar, you can make your own by mixing a few drops of food coloring with a glossy decoupage glue. Paint the outside of the jar with the mixture using a paintbrush or a foam brush.   You can also paint the jar with a matte decoupage glue or matte spray-on sealer. This will give the glass a frosted look, and will work best with the battery-operated string lights.  , You can print out silhouettes of fairies and cut them out using a craft knife.

If your parents don’t want to give you an allowance for doing work, try explaining to them that by giving you an allowance, you won’t need to rely on your parents every time you go out.   Earning an allowance is like a job. By getting paid for your services you can start to build a great work ethic that will help you as you get older. Come up with a proposal for your parents. Make a schedule for the week and write down what sort of tasks you are willing to do and how much you think those tasks are worth. Then, you and your parents can negotiate your allowance., Cleaning rooms in your home is a great way to earn an allowance. Whether you agree to clean the windows, dust, or vacuum, there are plenty of tasks you can complete to earn your allowance.   Keeping your own room clean may not be enough for an allowance. Chances are your parents think that you should be responsible for keeping your room clean on your own. So offer to go above and beyond and clean other rooms in the house. Discuss with your parents about how much each room or chore may pay you. Maybe cleaning the hallway doesn’t pay as much as the dining room, since the hallway is much smaller and takes less time.  , Doing seasonal, outside housework is another great way to earn an allowance since it’s work your parents may not have time, or want to do themselves.   Offer to rake leaves, shovel snow, mow the lawn, and weed gardens. If you’re doing a seasonal, but consistent chore like mowing the lawn or shoveling your driveway, you can talk to your parents about a set rate for each time you do this chore. If you’re raking leaves, try negotiating an hourly rate.  ","From the given data, the most important concepts are:

1. **Proposal for an Allowance**: The idea of creating a schedule for weekly chores and negotiating an allowance for completing them. This proposal emphasizes the value of work ethic and financial independence.

2. **Chores and Their Valuation**: The suggestion to consider the size, complexity, and time required for each task when valuing it for an allowance. This acknowledges that different tasks have varying levels of effort and importance.

3. **Offering Beyond Room Cleaning**: The encouragement to go beyond just cleaning one's own room to include other areas of the house, such as cleaning the kitchen, bathrooms, or even the entire house, to earn a higher allowance. This highlights the importance of taking on additional responsibilities.

4. **Seasonal Chores**: The recognition of seasonal tasks that parents might not have time or inclination to do, such as raking leaves, shoveling snow, mowing the lawn, and weeding gardens. This acknowledges the value of these tasks and the potential for a higher allowance for them.

5. **Negotiation**: The key role of negotiation in determining the amount of allowance based on the value of the chores completed. This approach encourages open communication and mutual agreement between the child and their parents.

6. **Financial Independence**: The underlying message that earning an allowance through work teaches responsibility and the value of money, preparing the child for financial independence in the future.

To summarize, the proposal for an allowance based on a chore schedule, the valuation of tasks, and the negotiation process are the core concepts. This approach not only teaches financial responsibility but also encourages children to take on additional responsibilities and negotiate their value within the family dynamic.",1.1721587708478952e-155,0.05442176870748299,0.013698630136986299,0.04761904761904762,0.7909507751464844,0.8653674125671387,0.8264873623847961,0.09562982005141389

If you spend less than that, you will be harnessed a bike that needs a lot of work, effort, and money. Also, don't spend you entire budget on the bike, as there will always be unexpected costs.; , The type of bike you get is totally up to you. 2-stroke, 4-stroke, big, or small. If you're not sure, just search the web!  , Finding the right deal is the heart of buying a bike, and oftentimes bikes on places like Craigslist are overpriced. Compare bike prices using eBay; If you find a bike you like, look at past auctions to see the going price.  , If you decide to buy one through Craigslist, it will be easy to get more information about the bike without committing too much information to the seller. Make sure to always contact the seller in the way they ask so you don’t tick them off.  , The more you know about different bikes, how they work, and the motor sport world, the more details you will have to talk about with the seller. When you know what you are talking about, you can find ways to lower the sellers asking price.  , Negotiations start with the first contact. If you are too eager, the seller will get anxious and likely keep his price high because you make him feel like it’s worth more than it is. You can never be too calm about a deal. The more calm and confident you are the better results you will have. However, don't be cocky, it will turn your seller off and tell him you know nothing about what you are talking about.  , If the headlight doesn't work, bring it up.

Don't go too far though, nothing is worse than a seller that comes to look at your bike and all he does is talk bad about it.  , Give him your bottom line and he might come closer to it than you think.

Budget: The cost of a bike is not cheap, but spending within the $300-$600 range can yield a bike that requires some effort and money to maintain. Bikes outside this price range may need more work and investment.

2. Budget allocation: Don't spend your entire budget on the bike, as there will be additional costs you might not anticipate.

3. Bike type: Choose the type of bike that suits your needs, whether it's a 2-stroke or 4-stroke, or based on size preferences. Research online to make an informed decision.

4. Deal hunting: Beware of overpriced bikes on platforms like Craigslist. Compare prices on eBay to find the best deals.

6. Knowledge: The more you know about different bikes, their mechanics, and the motor sport world, the more you can negotiate and potentially lower the seller's asking price.

7. Negotiation strategy: Be calm and confident during negotiations, as eagerness can make the seller anxious and inflate the price. Avoid being too critical or cocky.

8. Issues to raise: If the bike has issues, such as a non-functioning headlight, bring it up during negotiations. This can lead to a lower price.

9. Bottom line: Clearly state your bottom line during negotiations. If the seller doesn't agree, don't give in.

46," Find some friends., Talk to school administrators., Find a teacher as a sponsor., Find a meeting room., Publicize your club., Have your first meeting., Create your club’s structure., Plan projects.",How to Create an Environmental Club1," You won’t be able to do this alone, so you’ll need some people to help. Find a friend or two who cares about the environment like you do. This way, you can show others that people are already interested in your club, and you have members to help do the organizing to get things going.When you talk to other people about your club, listen to their ideas and concerns too. You might be able to fit into your potential club, making it more attractive for them to join.; , Any club that wants to draw in students and use school facilities needs to have permission from your principal or other school leader. They will tell you all the things you need to do to become an official school club, probably some paperwork. Along with this permission, they can also provide additional advice for good ways to start your club and get the word out., Most school clubs need an advisor from the faculty to help become official. Your faculty advisor will supervise your meetings, offer regular advice, and may even pitch in to help if needed. Your advisor doesn’t need to be an environmentalist, though someone who shares your concern for the environment would be a good place to start. Science teachers are probably the most likely to help, but anyone can be interested in helping the environment., When you start planning your first meeting, remember that you will need a classroom to hold it in. Make sure it is a room you can get to regularly. You will use it for scheduled meetings to discuss upcoming projects.The classroom of your advisor is probably your best bet, but check first. Someone else might be using it at different times, which will limit when you can schedule your meeting.  , Now that you have a club, make sure people know about it. There are a variety of ways to spread the word about a school club. For all of them, remember to include the name of your club, and the time and place of your first meeting. You can include other information if you want, but it needs at least that much. If people don’t know about your club and your meetings, they won’t know to attend.   Post fliers around the school. Your school probably has lots of posters for different clubs and activities. Look for ways to help yours stand out and get people’s attention. You might try printing on recycled paper, green color paper, or posters with pictures of celebrities who care about environmental causes.If your school has rules about posters and fliers, make sure you know what they are, and that you follow all instructions. If your school does announcements in the morning, over a loudspeaker or a television, make sure your club gets a mention. Talk to the person who controls the announcements, usually the principal or a teacher, about how to make sure your message gets read to the school. A good way to get people’s attention is to give a presentation in front of them. You probably won’t get the whole school, so talk to your principal or teacher about giving an announcement in your homeroom or other classes. This will give students a chance to see you directly, rather than having your club announced with a bunch of other things in the morning. Another good way to spread the word is to have your members talk to a new potential member about the club and try to encourage them to come to the next meeting. You won’t get all of these people, but even a few new arrivals can help your club grow., Once you have some people interested, and a place to meet, have your first meeting. Get people to show up and talk about what the club will be doing. Talk about what you want the club to accomplish, and how everyone will be involvedThe most important thing you can do at this meeting, along with making sure people know about your club, is to get contact information. If someone shows up, make sure you get people’s names, phone numbers, and emails. This way, you’ll be able to keep in contact with them when trying to schedule future meetings. Be sure to also give them some contact information for the club, so they can contact you if they need something. One good way to encourage people to show up to the first meeting is to provide snacks. If you are going to have food, make sure you mention it when you tell people about the meeting, so it will encourage them to come. During your first meeting, make sure you schedule and announce your next meeting. Regular meetings will help people build time in their schedule and make sure to attend, which is important for a new club.  , Once you have some people gathered, you’ll need to figure out how your club should be structured and run. It shouldn’t just be one person doing all the work and deciding what happens. Instead, create some rules for how the club decides what to do, and choose some officers.If you can, try to give your club a statement of purpose, a couple of sentences that explains who you are and what you are trying to do. This is important to help explain to people what your club believes in, and why they would want to join up. Your first meeting might be a good time to decide the kind of officers you want your club to have rather than picking him right away. Some positions to consider include a president, project coordinator, secretary, treasurer, and public relations coordinator. Make sure your club is clear about what holding these positions will entail, so you can find the right people for them.  , Once your club has started, you’ll want to start doing projects to carry out your environmental goals. The list of potential projects is endless, but to start with you should probably focus on doing something around the school.This will help spread the word about your club and get more students interested. Once you get a larger club, you’ll be able to take on even bigger projects.   You should probably have one or two ideas when you start the club. That way you can get started on something quickly, which will keep your new members interested. Once those are done, you can start taking ideas and suggestions from other club members, which should give you a nice long list of things to do. Part of planning projects may include raising money to pay for those projects. When you start your club, your school may have a budget that you can use. That may not be enough, though, so when you start planning projects think about how much money you will need to do things and how you can raise that money.","1. **Need People to Help**: To start an environmental club, you need friends who care about the environment.

3. **Permission from Principal**: To form a school club, you need permission from the principal. They can provide advice and paperwork for the process.

4. **Faculty Advisor**: Find a faculty advisor who can supervise meetings, offer advice, and help with club activities. An advisor doesn't have to be an environmentalist but should share your concerns.

5. **First Meeting**: Plan a first meeting in a classroom, preferably the advisor's. Ensure it's a regular time and get contact information from attendees.

6. **Spread the Word**: Use posters, school announcements, presentations, and member-to-member recruitment to let people know about the club.

7. **First Meeting Details**: At the first meeting, discuss the club's goals, involve everyone, and get contact information from attendees. Provide snacks to encourage attendance.

8. **Club Structure**: Decide on club rules and roles (e.g., president, project coordinator, secretary, treasurer, public relations coordinator). Have a clear statement of purpose.

9. **Projects**: Start with small, school-based projects. As the club grows, consider bigger, more ambitious projects.

10. **Raising Money**: For projects, consider using the school's budget or raising money through fundraising activities.

11. **Regular Meetings**: Schedule regular meetings to keep the club active and build member attendance.

12. **Adaptability**: Be open to changing the club's structure, goals, and projects based on feedback and member interest.

Green primer is lightweight and more sheer than most concealers. It will be less likely to look caked on. However, with very bright, obvious pimples it's best to go with concealer as it's stronger., Many people are insecure about their concealer looking caked on.

49," Transplant the jade plant in early spring., Use a heavy clay, terra cotta or ceramic container., Make sure the container has at least one drain hole in the bottom., Find a container that is only 1 to 2 inches deeper and wider than the old container., Use a peat-based potting mix with extra coarse builder’s sand or perlite added in., Put the new potting mix into the container at a depth of 1 to 2 inches., Remove the jade plant from its old container., Disinfect a pair of sharp scissors with a household disinfectant like Lysol., Trim off any roots that are much longer than the root mass., Put the jade plant in the new container., Water the jade plant with room-temperature water until it drains from the bottom., Take special care of the jade plant for four weeks after transplanting it., Water the plant with room-temperature water when the top of the potting mix begins to dry., Do not overwater the plant., Avoid giving the plant any fertilizer while the root system is recovering., Keep the plant out of direct sunlight.",How to Transplant a Jade Plant," This is the time when they are just entering a season of vigorous growth.They recover from the stress of being repotted more easily and quickly during this season.; , This will help to keep the plant upright.Jade plants tend to become top heavy and fall over easily.  , This will allow excess water to drain from the pot.   If the excess water cannot drain away, it will keep the potting soil too moist and restrict air movement which can cause root rot and kill the plant.  , Larger containers will encourage excessive root growth or hold too much soil around the roots which will keep them wet for too long., This will allow the soil to drain more quickly.You can mix the perlite or sand into the potting mix at a ratio of two-thirds potting mix and one-third perlite or sand.  , The top of the jade plant root mass should be about 1 inch below the top of the container after it is transplanted.  , Do this by laying the pot on its side, grasping the base of the stem in your hand and sliding the roots out., Soak them in the disinfectant for five minutes, rinse them in tap water and dry them off with a clean towel.   This will kill fungal spores and bacteria that may infect the jade plant.  , Then, cut the roots off so they are even with the rest of the root mass.   Trimming off these long roots will cause the plant to develop a healthier root system within the root mass.  , Then, fill in the spaces around the roots with potting mix.  , This will settle the soil around the roots and give the plant some moisture.   If there is a saucer beneath the container to catch the water that drains from the hole, empty it after watering the plant. Water left in the saucer could leach back up into the potting mix and keep the roots too wet.  , The jade plant will be stressed from being transplanted and should be cared for a little differently while it recovers.  , The jade plant needs to be watered more often than usual because the root system has been compromised and cannot absorb water efficiently.Room-temperature water will not shock the roots like cold tap water. If the jade plant is not getting enough water, its succulent leaves will begin to shrivel and may develop brown spots., Too much water will cause the leaves to turn yellow.  , The jade plant does not need fertilizer during this time and it could burn the roots.  , As the leaves are not receiving moisture as efficiently as usual, they could be burned by too much sunlight.  ","1. Vigorous growth season: This is the time when plants enter a phase of rapid growth, during which they recover more easily from stress, such as repotting.

2. Repotting stress recovery: Plants recover more quickly and easily from stress during the vigorous growth season, which is ideal for repotting.

3. Maintaining plant uprightness: Jade plants tend to become top-heavy and may fall over easily, so proper support is necessary.

4. Drainage: Ensuring that excess water can drain from the pot is crucial to prevent root rot and maintain healthy soil moisture levels.

5. Avoiding excessive root growth: Larger containers can lead to excessive root growth or too much soil around the roots, which can keep them wet for too long.

6. Drainage aids: Adding perlite or sand to the potting mix can improve drainage, allowing the soil to dry out more quickly.

7. Transplanting: After transplanting, ensure the root mass is below the top of the container, and remove the plant from the pot carefully.

8. Disinfection: Clean the roots in a disinfectant to kill fungal spores and bacteria that may infect the plant.

9. Root trimming: Trim long roots to create a healthier root system within the root mass.

10. Filling gaps: Fill in the spaces around the roots with potting mix to secure the plant and provide moisture.

11. Saucer management: Empty any water collected in the saucer beneath the container after watering to prevent water leaching back into the potting mix.

12. Recovery care: The jade plant needs to be watered more often during the recovery period to compensate for the compromised root system.

13. Watering considerations: Use room-temperature water and avoid cold tap water, as it can shock the roots. Insufficient water can lead to leaf shriveling and brown spots, while too much water can cause yellow leaves.

14. Fertilizer and sunlight: The jade plant does not require fertilizer during this time and may be susceptible to sunburn due to less efficient moisture absorption.",0.025413468691006084,0.40697674418604646,0.12451361867704279,0.19767441860465118,0.8229459524154663,0.8426070213317871,0.832660436630249,0.2491569986163675

You should have five cork discs.  , Once you are done, you should have a total of 15 cork discs.  , This will create the fractal design of your coaster., Once you are happy with the shape, place a bit of hot glue on the sides of the cork discs to glue them together.Set this pentagon aside and allow it to dry.  , Use five more cork discs to create another pentagon shape.  , Apply glue to each piece of cork and reform your pentagon. Try to be sure that your pentagons are matched as close to possible, the way a real fractal would appear in nature.  , Using the last pieces of cork, glue together the final fractal just as you did the previous two. Again, try to get each of the fractals to match in shape as close to possible.  , Place glue on one of the sides of the cork fractal and adhere it directly to the side of another.  , This last piece will come into contact with both of the other cork fractals, so you need to be sure to apply glue to two adjacent sides.Once you have applied the glue, slide the final fractal into the other two so that it roughly forms a triangular shape.  , Both sides may look identical, or not. The side you want to be displayed once the coaster is complete is up to you.  , After you have decided which side of the coaster you would like to be displayed (or up), go ahead and lay it down on a flat surface display side down.  , Not just each cork fractal, but each individual disc. You will need to work rather quickly so that the glue does not begin to dry before you are finished applying it to each disc.  , You should do this before the glue dries to make sure that the cork pieces properly adhere. Once you have the felt in position, use your palms to apply a gently amount of pressure to the felt. This will make sure the glue fills any gaps between the felt and the uneven surfaces of cork.   The felt will help maintain the form of the coaster., Once the hot glue has dried you can trim the excess felt. Using a pair of sharp scissors, cut along the edge of the corks to remove any excess felt.  ","1. **Cork Slicing**: Divide a cork into five equally sized slices by using a sharp knife, slicing it horizontally like a cucumber or salami.

2. **Cork Discs**: This process results in five cork discs.

3. **Fractal Design**: These cork discs are used to create a fractal design for the coaster.

4. **Pentagon Formation**: Form a pentagon shape with five cork discs, applying hot glue to the sides to join them together.

5. **Repeat for Another Pentagon**: Use five more cork discs to create another pentagon shape, ensuring it matches the first as closely as possible.

6. **Repeat for Final Pentagon**: Use the remaining cork discs to create the third pentagon, matching its shape as closely as possible to the previous two.

7. **Glue and Assembly**: Glue one side of the cork fractal to another, ensuring glue is applied to two adjacent sides.

8. **Triangular Formation**: Slide the final fractal into the other two, forming a triangular shape.

9. **Choosing the Display Side**: Decide which side of the coaster will be displayed (or ""up"") and position the coaster accordingly.

10. **Application of Felt**: Place the coaster display side down on a flat surface and apply felt to each individual cork disc to maintain the coaster's form.

11. **Gap Filling**: Use your palms to apply gentle pressure to the felt to ensure the glue fills any gaps between the felt and the cork.

12. **Trimming Excess Felt**: Once the hot glue has dried, trim the excess felt using sharp scissors, cutting along the edge of the cork to remove any unnecessary material.",0.060602106016560534,0.5363408521303258,0.20151133501259447,0.2907268170426065,0.8365958333015442,0.8807836771011353,0.8581212759017944,0.35992812219227316
51," Find a team., Learn how to aim with a Barricade., Battle on the front lines., Decide which type of dart to use., Keep extra ammunition handy., Use the Barricade's disadvantages to your advantage.",How to Win a Nerf War With a Barricade," Try to make it so that your team has at least 2 people. If you have a team, your teammate(s) have more guns, so you won't have to completely rely on your Barricade, because your teammate(s) will also be shooting. Also, with a teammate, you can use your teammate's guns instead of your Barricade.; , The Barricade shoots differently than other Nerf guns, and you will need to know how to aim it if you are going to use it in battle. Aim down the sights slightly higher than you want to shoot, increasing the height the farther you are from your target. Also, put the wind-speed into account. Because of the fact that Nerf darts are foam, the wind will easily blow them off-target. If the wind is blowing from the right, aim the gun slightly to the left, and vice versa.   Also, put the recoil of the Barricade into account. The Barricade is a semi-automatic weapon, and it will have recoil when you shoot it one shot after the other. One way to reduce the recoil would be to hold your breath when you are shooting it. Another way is to hold it with two hands when you are shooting it. Another way to reduce the recoil is to shoot slowly. When you shoot one shot after the other, there will be a whole lot of recoil. If you shoot slowly, there won't be as much. Do all three of those things to reduce the recoil, and you will be aiming like a professional.  , A Barricade was designed to be used while running, because of it's ability to be shot quickly and being lightweight. The Barricade is also very loud, and should not be used for stealth, although it can be modified. The Barricade is also quite small, so run around with it, and you are guaranteed success.  , If you want the darts to stick to walls, and your enemy, then use the suction darts. If you want the dart to make a sound when it is shot, and you want to get the attention of the enemy so that they stop attacking a teammate, then use the whistler darts. You can also use a mix of suction darts and whistler darts.  , Consider using a bandolier kit. The Barricade holds only 10 darts at one time, and they easily run out because of the fact that the gun is semi-automatic, and is usually shot with speed.  , The main disadvantage about the Barricade, is that it is unnecessarily loud. In order to turn the gun on, you have to deal with the loud humming/buzzing noise. A way to use this to your advantage, is to try to get the enemies' attention on you, and away from your teammates. While you fend off your enemies, your teammates can flank your enemies, and/or go to their base and steal ammo. Another disadvantage about the Barricade is that it isn't clip-fed, so you have to put darts inside one by one. There is a couple of clever ways to use this to your advantage. One way is that you can put one or two darts inside the gun, and then surrender to an enemy that is alone. The darts will not be seen by the enemy, and he will be caught off guard. When he comes to take the gun from you, shoot his chest twice, and he will die. Another way to use this to your advantage is to sit in one area, and to shoot enemies that come by. This is called camping. You will need many darts beside you, because after every shot, you will put one dart inside the gun. You will not run out of ammunition until all of your darts run out. You can't do this with a gun that is clip-fed, though, and that is what is unique about the Barricade.   When you sit there, you should put a shoulder-stock on the gun, so that you can shoot more accurately.  ","From the given data, the key concepts are:

1. **Teamwork**: Having at least two people on a team allows for more guns, reducing reliance on the Barricade and providing additional firepower.

2. **Barricade Aiming**: The Barricade requires adjusting sights slightly higher than the target to compensate for distance and wind speed. Wind direction affects aim, requiring adjustments to the left or right based on the wind.

3. **Recoil Management**: The Barricade has recoil that can be mitigated by holding one's breath, using two hands, or shooting slowly.

4. **Barricade Design and Uses**:
   - The Barricade is designed for quick, light use while running, making it effective in fast-paced scenarios.
   - It is not suitable for stealth due to its loudness, but modifications can address this.
   - Suction darts for wall-sticking and whistler darts for sound and distraction are mentioned as tactical dart types.
   - Consider using a bandolier kit to increase the number of darts, as the Barricade's capacity is limited.

5. **Disadvantages of the Barricade**:
   - It is loud, which can be used to draw enemies away from teammates.
   - It is not clip-fed, meaning darts must be inserted one by one, which can be used tactically, such as in surprise attacks or for ambush strategies.
   - The Barricade's lack of a shoulder stock can affect accuracy, so using one is recommended for better aim.

6. **Tactical Use of the Barricade**:
   - The Barricade's semi-automatic nature allows for unique tactics like ""camping,"" where the user sits in one place and shoots incoming enemies, using up ammunition slowly.
   - Surrendering the gun to an enemy, then shooting them upon taking the weapon, is another tactic that exploits the Barricade's reload mechanism.

In summary, the Barricade is best utilized in team-based scenarios, with team members sharing the load of shooting and using its unique features for strategic advantage, such as its semi-automatic fire, loudness for distraction, and the need to manually load darts for extended use.",1.9379628011475745e-155,0.12742382271468145,0.033426183844011144,0.09418282548476455,0.7903661727905273,0.8440810441970825,0.8163409233093262,0.13665594855305466

59," Select the paste you will use., Restrain the calf., Immobilize the cow’s head., Use a sedative if you do not have a chute to put your cow in., Locate the horn bud., Apply 3 ml to 5ml of 2% lidocaine into the base of the horn bud., Apply a protective layer of vaseline around the base of the horn bud., Apply the caustic paste., Allow the calf to rest.",How to Dehorn a Cow2," There are many pastes out on the market. Always read the labels of these products; many of these products can be used on calves that are up to eight weeks old, and can also be used on calves immediately after birth. However, some pastes may have an age limit, so always double check.  , The first step in using a dehorning paste is to restraint the calf by placing it inside a restraining chute. A restraining chute is a metal cage composed of metal tubes. It can fit one cow or calf at a time, and has a special space in front where the cow’s head can fit. Once the head is passed through the open space, special bars or tubes can be fixed and adjusted so that the cow’s head can be firmly held in place.  , Once the cow’s head is in place, have an assistant move the cow’s head towards the assistant’s thighs. To do this, have the assistant push the cow’s muzzle with his left hand so that the cow’s muzzle rests against the assistant’s thigh. For the right horn, the assistant would use his right hand.Another way to restrain a calf is by placing it in a chute and having an assistant push the calf forward so that the head protrudes outside of the chute. Another assistant can then use his left hip to push the head of the calf against the vertical post of the chute, making the head turn at a right angle with the vertical post of the chute. The left hand is then used to support and hold the back of the head. In this way the horn buds are exposed while the animal is immobilized.  , The calf can also be restrained by administering a sedative like Xylazine. Once the calf is sedated, the calf is gently laid down in a lying position and the front and hind limbs are tied down.  , Once the calf is sedated, feel for the horn bud on the calf’s head. Gently trim away hair on and around the horn bud. Lightly brush the horn bud with a small wire brush.   Do not brush the bud too hard or else it may bleed.  , Locate the occipital groove, which runs behind the cow’s eye and into the horn. Once you find the groove, inject the lidocaine at the base of the bud.   Make sure to hold the syringe at a 45 degree angle away from the eye. Wait 10 to 20 minutes for the medication to take effect.  , Apply the vaseline with your index finger and make sure that it does not get on the horn bud.  , Using a wood applicator or a syringe, apply a thin film of dehorning paste over the entire horn bud and over a small ring of adjacent skin. Only one application of the paste is necessary.   In calves that are one week of age or younger, the entire application area may only be the size of a nickel. In calves that are older than one week, the application area may be the size of a quarter.  , Once the application has been placed on the horn buds, allow the calf to rest away from other animals and in a place protected from the elements.  ","1. **Read Labels**: When purchasing dehorning pastes, always check the product's label to ensure it is suitable for calves up to eight weeks old and can be used immediately after birth, or if there are any age restrictions.

2. **Restraining Chute**: Use a restraining chute to safely restrain the calf during dehorning. This involves placing the calf inside the chute and securing its head in place with special bars or tubes.

3. **Alternative Restraint Methods**: For calves that cannot be restrained in a chute, assistants can use alternative methods such as pushing the cow's head towards their thighs or by immobilizing the calf with a sedative like Xylazine.

4. **Sedation**: Administering a sedative like Xylazine can help immobilize the calf, making it easier to work on.

5. **Trimming Hair and Applying Lidocaine**: Gently trim the hair around the horn bud and apply lidocaine at the base of the bud. Wait for the medication to take effect before proceeding.

6. **Vaseline Application**: Apply a thin film of vaseline over the horn bud and a small ring of adjacent skin, ensuring it does not come into contact with the bud.

7. **Dehorning Paste Application**: Apply a thin film of dehorning paste over the entire horn bud area, adjusting the size of the application area based on the calf's age (a nickel for week-old calves, a quarter for older calves).

8. **Protected Environment**: After applying the dehorning paste, keep the calf in a protected, sheltered area away from other animals to prevent injury or contamination.

These concepts highlight the importance of proper product selection, safe restraint techniques, and careful application of dehorning paste and medications to ensure the process is humane and effective.",0.019997332515451167,0.3107344632768361,0.14204545454545456,0.21468926553672316,0.8181779384613037,0.8611358404159546,0.8391074538230896,0.24417314095449502

If your yard doesn't have a tree with a branch that meets these standards, consider a different project.   Oak trees are ideal, but any type of sturdy hardwood tree may be used. Evergreens and fruit trees should be avoided. Pick a healthy branch that is at least eight inches in diameter. Carefully inspect for any signs of disease or splitting. A sickly branch is more likely to break off and fall, potentially causing serious injury to anyone below. The placement of your swing should be at least three to five feet out from the tree's trunk. Press down on the branch at the point where you intend to hang your swing. If the branch bounces, choose a sturdier one. Do not pick a branch that is too high off the ground. Twenty feet should be the maximum,but if you are making a swing for a young child, consider a lower branch. Remember that the higher the swing's attachment point, the greater the height your child may fall from.; , You will need wood, rope, twine, three-inch deck screws, wood glue, fine grit sandpaper, two stainless steel quick link carabiners, and the right tools for the job.   For tools, you will need a saw, a leveler, measuring tape, a sanding block, and a cordless drill. Buy enough 1.5-inch thick pressure treated wood for the job. You will need enough for three 7.25-inch wide pieces: one measuring 36 inches in length and two that are each 4 inches long. A two-by-eight board that is four feet long will be the easiest to work with. (If you are new to woodworking, keep in mind that the actual width and thickness of a two-by-eight are 7.25 inches and 1.5 inches respectively.)You will need a rope that is twice your planned swing's height (from the branch to the seat) plus an additional 12 feet. Use twisted polypropylene rope at least 3/8 inches in diameter. Keep in mind that nylon rope is typically too slippery for a good swing and a natural-fiber rope will eventually rot. Cut the rope into four pieces: two 10-foot lengths and two that are one foot longer than your swing's height., Throw one end of each rope up over the branch. Position the two ropes so that they are slightly over three feet apart. Tie a running bowline slip knot to one end of each rope. Next, thread the free end of each rope through its corresponding knot. Tug each free end to tighten the knot onto the branch.   This type of knot is very secure but will also expand with the growing tree. If needed, you can attach one end of each rope to a rock with some twine before attempting to throw it. This extra step will make getting the ends up over the branches much easier., Remember that the base of your swing will be made up of three rectangles that will all be 7.25 inches wide. Mark two rectangles that are 4 inches for the supports and a third that is 36 inches for the main seat. Double-check your measurements before you begin sawing., To avoid the potential problem of the swing's seat cutting into the rider's thigh, sand down the front and rear top edges of your main seat piece. These will be two of the long edges on the same face of the board.You may also choose to sand down the other edges of the seat, but this is not necessary.  , Arrange the two supports each on opposite ends of the main board. If you only sanded down the top edges, make sure the support pieces are on side opposite from where you sanded. First, secure the pieces in place with wood glue. Next, reinforce the attachment using five deck screws for each support piece. Pattern the screws so that one is near each corner with the fifth directly in the center., Place two holes on each end through both the seat and its supports. Try to make each hole the same distance from the supports' edges and the center screw. The two holes on each side should create a line parallel to the seat's short side and perpendicular to its long side. Make sure the holes are wide enough to thread your rope through but not much wider., Use one rope for the two holes on one end and the second rope on the other. The two ropes should not cross. Position the ropes so that their ends are on the same side as the support pieces.  , Tie four stopper knots, one at each end of the ropes underneath the swing seat. Do not tie the knots too tight in case you need to adjust them later. There should now be two slings, one attached to each end of the seat., Unscrew your carabiners and hook one onto each sling. Screw the locking sleeves back on tight. Next, tie the ends of each rope hanging down to the quick links using a secure knot, such as a buntline hitch., Place a leveler on the seat to check for unevenness. If your seat isn't level, adjust the stopper knots accordingly. For example, if the seat is dipping forward and to the left, pull a little more rope through the bottom and move the knot up. Once the seat is level, tighten your knots. Your swing is now ready for use.  ","The most important concepts from the provided data are:

1. **Selecting a Safe and Sturdy Tree**: Choose a tree with a healthy, sturdy branch at least eight inches in diameter, preferably an oak or any type of hardwood tree, but avoid evergreens and fruit trees.

2. **Branch Inspection**: Ensure the branch is not too high off the ground (maximum 20 feet) and inspect for signs of disease or splitting, as these can lead to breakage and pose a risk of injury.

3. **Swing Placement**: Place the swing at least three to five feet out from the tree's trunk to ensure safety.

4. **Materials and Tools**: Prepare the necessary materials and tools for constructing the swing, including wood, rope, tools for woodworking, and specific fasteners like screws and carabiners.

5. **Swing Construction**:
   - Cut the wood and rope according to specific measurements.
   - Secure the ropes to the branch using a running bowline slip knot and additional knots for stability.
   - Sand the wood pieces for comfort and to prevent injury.
   - Assemble the swing base with wood glue and deck screws, ensuring the supports are on opposite sides of the seat.
   - Drill holes for the ropes, positioning them to maintain the swing's balance.
   - Tie stopper knots in the ropes under the seat to adjust for leveling.
   - Attach carabiners to the ropes and secure them to the seat.
   - Tie the remaining rope ends to the quick links for hanging the swing.
   - Check and adjust the levelness of the seat using a leveler.

6. **Safety Precautions**: The entire process emphasizes safety, from selecting a suitable tree branch to ensuring the swing is level and secure. Avoiding sickly branches and maintaining a safe distance from the ground and tree trunk are crucial for preventing accidents.

7. **Maintenance and Durability**: The construction process also highlights the importance of using durable materials and maintaining the swing for longevity, ensuring it remains safe for continued use.",3.2035176970842618e-155,0.2227979274611399,0.05208333333333333,0.16580310880829016,0.8019953966140747,0.8540289402008057,0.8271946907043457,0.20968447344614732

Most people are comfortable talking about things they like to do.   Maybe he likes a certain band or loves videogames or movies. Or maybe it’s a sport he’s interested in. Act genuinely interested in his interests (but if his interests truly bore you and you’re completely faking it, consider that he’s not the right guy for you.) Even better yet, figure out areas of common interest that you both like and start there so that your interest is genuine.

Ask him about something he likes to do or is interested in, such as whether he saw the latest movie with his favorite actor. Asking questions draws shy people out of their shells by helping stimulate their side of the conversation. Use your intellect. Ask open-ended questions. These are questions that are phrased to elicit an explanatory, detailed response. Start the question with words like what, how, in what way, and why. Asking questions that start with words like “do” will provoke terse, single-word yes or no responses.  , Maybe it’s just conversation that unnerves the shy guy and stands outside his comfort zone.   He’s probably an observer who’s deep but has trouble expressing that to strangers or people he doesn’t know very well.  Flirt with him by asking for his help with something. A lot of guys do feel comfortable with being the person who helps out. Consider it their inner knight coming to the surface.

The looped part should be facing your hairline and the two tails should be hanging down the back of your head., The easiest way to do this would be to simply feed the middle section through the loop. The kanekalon strand should now be between your real hair and your scalp. Make sure that it is centered.  , Make sure that the center (folded) part of the kanekalon strand is tucked under the middle section of your braid. Add the left side of the strand to the left section of your braid, and the right side to the right section., Holding the left side of the kanekalon hair and the left section of your braid together, cross them over the middle section. Repeat this step for the right section.If you want a thicker cornrow, add another strand of kanekalon hair to the middle section after you cross the right section.  , This time, take a slightly-thicker strand than before. Tuck it under the middle strand, and add the left and right sides to the left and right sections of your braid., For a thinner, more natural braid, add the kanekalon after you cross both the left and right sections. For a thicker, more dramatic braid, add the kanekalon after every cross-over.Start with the thinner strands and work your way to the thicker ones. Keep your stitches nice and tight. Use more curling cream to smooth down any stray hairs, if needed.  , You can regular-braid the kanekalon hair for a few more inches/centimeters if you'd like to, but leave the bottom half of the hair unbraided for now., Hold a pair of scissors parallel to the strand with the tips pointing upward. Cut into the end of the strand to thin it out. You only need to thin the bottom few inches/centimeters. This will help your braid maintain the same thickness throughout., Do a regular braid for this. Keep the stitches nice and tight. You can braid as far down as you like, but more stylists will braid all the way down to the end of the extension.If you are not braiding all the way down, cut off the excess extensions.  , Wrap a thin hair elastic a few times around the end of the braid. Tuck the tail under the elastic, then wrap the elastic a few more times. This conceals the end without having to deal with heat-sealing., You may have noticed that there are some hairs sticking out of the folded end of your braid. This is perfectly normal. Use a small pair of scissors to trim away any stray strands., This can get tiring, especially if you are doing it by yourself. Remember to take breaks, especially if your arms start to feel sore. You can use the same color of extension for each cornrow, or you can add a few colored ones for a unique look.  , Use your fingers to apply some hydrating hair cream to the fine hairs at your hairline. Smooth them down and back with a soft bristle brush.","1. Focus on the roots for dry hair treatment.

Heat the mixture on the stovetop, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Remove from heat once it begins to simmer, before it reaches a full boil.White granulated sugar is fine, but if you’d prefer a hint of molasses, use raw cane sugar or natural brown sugar instead. If your syrup reaches a boil, it’s not the end of the world. You’ll just have to wait a few extra minutes before moving on to the next step. If, however, it's boiled so long that it has begun to reduce in volume, measure how much liquid is left and add the difference.; , After you remove your syrup from the burner, give it a few minutes to cool down a little. While it sits, pour 2 cups (200 g) of cranberries into a medium glass bowl. Once the water has cooled off a little, pour it into the bowl. Seal the bowl with a lid, foil, or plastic wrap. Then place it in the refrigerator to chill overnight.You want to let the water cool off before pouring to avoid bursting the cranberries. To eliminate this risk entirely, wait until the water cools off to room temperature.  , After your berries have chilled overnight, pour them into a strainer and let any excess moisture drain. Then dry your glass bowl with a towel or paper towels. Add a spoonful of sugar, then about a small portion of your berries. Toss them with a couple spoons or by covering the bowl with its lid and shaking it to coat the berries with sugar, which will stick to the glaze.  Once they are more or less evenly coated, transfer to them to a baking sheet. Then repeat until you have coated all your berries. Working in small portions will help coat each berry more evenly. It will also prevent the sugar from clumping up due to too much moisture.  , Once you have coated all your berries, give the sugar a few hours to dry to the berries. Then give them a look-over. If there are any bare spots, or if you just prefer a sweeter treat, toss them again with more sugar.By now the glaze should be well on its way to dry, so it should only take another hour for the added sugar to dry to your berries.

69," Know what flavor to expect., Get what you pay for., Opt for whole saffron instead of ground., Store the saffron carefully., Crush and soak the threads., Toast the threads., Crumble and add directly., Use a small amount., Use saffron in grain-based recipes., Add saffron to desserts., Combine saffron with other flavors as desired., Do your research., Take saffron extract for medicinal purposes., Make your skin glow., Drink saffron milk.",How to Use Saffron," Saffron has a pungent, musty taste and scent with sweet floral accents. When used in excess, however, the taste can quickly become bitter.   Saffron has a flavor profile similar to vanilla: sweet and musky. The two typically work well together, but they are not similar enough to serve as strict substitutes for one another. Turmeric and safflower are often used instead of saffron to give foods a similar color, but the flavors are much different.; , Harvesting saffron is a labor-intensive process, so if you want high-quality saffron, prepare yourself for an expensive purchase.   Examine the saffron before you buy it. Good saffron consists of fine, evenly sized threads that are deep red in color with an orange tendril on one end and a trumpet-shaped flute on the other. If the tendril looks yellow, the saffron is likely real but of slightly poorer quality. Additionally, a stronger scent also indicates a stronger, better flavor. In comparison, fake saffron may look like shredded, irregular threads with disconnected tendrils and pieces of bark mixed into the package. The scent may not be very strong and usually smells like bark.  , Simply put, whole saffron has a stronger flavor than ground saffron. Ground saffron can be a good substitute if you cannot find or afford the whole spice, though.   If you do decide to buy ground saffron, go through a reputable spice seller. Less honest sellers may cut saffron with other spices, including turmeric and paprika, to reduce the overall cost.  , Saffron doesn't spoil, but it will gradually lose its flavor in storage. Proper storage can preserve the saffron for longer periods, however.   Wrap the saffron threads in foil and place them in an airtight container. Store them in a cool, dark place for up to 6 months. For longer storage, keep the container of saffron in your freezer for up to 2 years.Note that ground saffron should be used within 3 to 6 months and stored in an airtight container and a cool, dark place.  , The process of crushing and soaking saffron releases the maximum amount of flavor from the threads, so it's strongly recommended.   Take the saffron threads you intend to use for the recipe and crush them into a powder using a mortar and pestle. If you don't have a mortar and pestle, you can crumble the threads in between your fingers.Steep the crushed saffron in warm water, stock, milk, or white wine for 20 to 30 minutes. If there's any liquid in your recipe, use a small amount of the specified liquid from the instructions.Add the saffron and soaking liquids directly to your recipe when called for.  , Toasting is another common way to prepare saffron, and it's especially common for traditional paella recipes.   Place a cast iron skillet on the stove over medium heat. Add the saffron threads to the hot skillet. Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 or 2 minutes. They should release an even stronger aroma but should not be allowed to burn. Cool slightly and grind the toasted saffron threads using a mortar and pestle. This powder can be soaked or added directly to the recipe.  , While not ideal, you can crumble and add the threads of saffron directly to the dish while you cook it if the recipe calls for a large amount of liquid.   Note that if you use commercially ground saffron, you'll typically add it directly to the dish instead of soaking it.  , In large qualities, saffron will produce a bitter flavor. It's best to prepare and use very small amounts in your dishes.   When possible, count the threads instead of measuring them by volume. Note that a ""pinch"" of saffron equals about 20 medium threads, and a pinch is usually enough in most recipes that serve four to six people. When using powdered saffron instead of whole threads, note that 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of powder equals about 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of threads.This amount is usually enough for recipes that serve 8 to 12 people; scale it as needed based on the number of servings.  , Most traditional recipes calling for saffron are grain-based, including risotto, pilaf, and paella.   You can find a recipe that calls for saffron or add it to a basic recipe. As a general guideline, add about 30 threads of saffron to four servings of risotto or pilaf made with 12 oz (300 g) of rice. Add 50 threads of saffron to a paella recipe that serves four., Since saffron has a flavor profile similar to vanilla, it works well in many desserts that typically feature vanilla as the primary flavor.This includes custard, plain pastry, and sweet breads.   For custards, only add a pinch of saffron to the recipe per four servings. For pastry and plain cookies, use 15 to 20 threads of saffron for every 8 oz (200 g) of flour called for in the recipe. Note that butter accents the taste of saffron better than margarine. For sweet breads, adding 15 threads of saffron per 1 lb (450 g) of flour will create a subtle flavor, but you can add up to 60 threads for the same amount of flour if you'd prefer a stronger taste.  , If you want saffron to serve as the primary flavor in a dish, you'll need to avoid adding other spices, herbs, or aromatics. When mixed with other spices, however, saffron can give dishes an overall deeper flavor.   When mixing saffron into dishes flavored with other seasonings, it's best to use only a pinch. Add the saffron early on so that the flavor can blend into the other ingredients more thoroughly. Seasonings frequently paired with saffron include cinnamon, cumin, almond, onion, garlic, and vanilla. If you plan to add saffron to meat or vegetable dishes, gravitate toward those based on light meats and vegetables. For example, you could try adding it to a chicken or cauliflower dish.  , While saffron is most commonly used in cooking and baking, it can also be used for medicinal or cosmetic purposes. Research the effects of saffron thoroughly before using it for non-culinary purposes, though.   Early research suggests that saffron might be effective as an alternative treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, depression, menstrual discomfort, and premenstrual syndrome.There is little to no research to suggest that saffron is effective against asthma, infertility, psoriasis, digestive trouble, baldness, insomnia, pain, cancer, or other conditions. Avoid taking more than 12 to 20 grams of saffron since such large amounts can actually be toxic. You should also avoid medicinal saffron if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, or if you're suffering from bipolar disorder, low blood pressure, or various heart conditions.  , Under the guidance of a physician, you could take a pure, high-quality saffron extract to help treat Alzheimer's disease, depression, menstrual discomfort, or premenstrual syndrome.For Alzheimer's disease, take 30 mg per day for 22 weeks to improve symptoms. Note that this will not cure the disease, however. For depression, take 15 to 30 mg per day. Continue for six to eight weeks. Results may be as effective as a low-dose antidepressant in some individuals. For menstrual discomfort, take 500 mg of an extract containing saffron, celery seed, and anise up to three times daily for the first three days of menstruation. For premenstrual syndrome, take 15 mg of an ethanol saffron extract up to twice daily while symptoms last. The effect usually kicks in after two menstrual complete menstrual cycles.  , Topical applications of saffron are traditionally used to lighten, brighten, and clear skin. The exact application procedure will vary based on its intended purpose, though.   Use a saffron milk mask to hydrate and soften skin. Soak a pinch of saffron threads in about 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of cold milk for several minutes, then splash the mixture onto freshly cleaned skin. After it dries, wash it away with lukewarm water. To treat acne, crush 5 to 6 basil leaves with 10 to 12 threads of saffron, forming a paste. Apply the paste directly to the acne. After 10 to 15 minutes pass, wash away the paste with cool water. To soften skin over the entire body, sprinkle about 30 threads into very warm bath water. Soak yourself in the water for about 20 to 25 minutes., Aside from being a tasty beverage, saffron milk is commonly believed to help brighten your complexion when routinely enjoyed several times a week.   Boil 2 cups (500 ml) of whole milk over high heat. As soon as the milk boils, add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) sliced almonds, 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) saffron threads, 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground cardamom, and 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of honey. Simmer for 5 minutes.Enjoy the drink while it's still hot.  ","1. Saffron has a pungent, musty taste with sweet floral accents, similar to vanilla, but can become bitter in excess.

This means laughing about the unique and sometimes funny tics that accompany the syndrome.Some of the involuntary verbal tics people say are creative and humorous. Just as you would laugh at a joke someone tells, finding humor in the things you say can help you break the stigma on yourself. Acknowledge that you are funny, which is a great part of your personality.This doesn’t mean to laugh at someone because he is different or to make fun of someone. Finding humor in Tourette’s phrases acknowledges that some of the verbal tics can create funny imagery and that’s a good thing instead of laughing at someone who is different. Laughter is a great way to break down the fear or anxiety people might feel about Tourette’s. If a person is unfamiliar with how a person with Tourette’s acts, she may find the tics, verbal outbursts, and uncontrollable motions scary. By approaching your condition with humor, you can help break that fear in someone, which is the first step in acceptance and understanding.; , Because people with Tourette’s may get bullied or discriminated against, they hide their condition. Hiding the condition just reinforces the idea that something is wrong with you, when there is nothing wrong with you. You are a unique, wonderful individual who deserves to live a full life being yourself - your whole self.Don’t choose to remain at home instead of going out because you are scared. You have the same right as everyone else to enjoy what the world offers. For places where your tics may be disruptive, talk to the people who run the place. Talk to them about disability accommodations, such as private boxes or VIP seating.  , Spending time with family and friends who know about your condition and understand it can help reduce the stigma. When you go out, bring people with you. If strangers see you with your Tourette’s interacting with people, it may help them be less fearful or discriminating., It may be helpful for you to find other people who have Tourette’s Syndrome. By talking to others, learning how they deal with the condition, and making friends with people who understand you, you can start to accept yourself, remove the stigma from yourself, and learn more about your condition.Try support groups for Tourette's Syndrome. You may also be able to talk to your doctor about finding other people with Tourette's. Some practices have patients who sign privacy waivers giving their doctor permission to share information with other people who have Tourette's.Look online for Tourette's organizations or meet-ups in your area.  , Because you have Tourette’s and have unique experiences, this can make you able to understand others better. Volunteer at a local organization. This can be a Tourette’s organization, or something else, like an animal shelter, food pantry, or even a blood drive., Instead of looking at your Tourette’s as a shameful disorder, celebrate the uniqueness of the condition. Tourette’s can be a very creative condition, whether it is the words you say or the unique way you move your body. Embrace these parts of yourself.Some organizations encourage people with Tourette’s to draw pictures featuring their tics. This can be an artistic representation of an involuntary phrase you say, or a picture of your tic.Writing, playing music, or engaging in other art forms, such as painting or sculpting may also help.Other people have used their Tourette's as inspiration for dance and theater productions.If you enjoy one of these forms of expression, then you might consider developing a dance routine, monologue, or play based on your Tourette's.  , Another way to take control of your life and break the stigma of Tourette’s is to research the condition. This includes learning everything you can about Tourette’s, talking to your doctor, and being active in your treatment plan., Many foundations have conferences for people with Tourette’s or neurological conditions. Attending these conferences can help you learn more about your condition, along with meeting other people with the condition, learning how to embrace it, and learning how to live a more fulfilling life.Try searching organizations, such as the Tourette’s Association of America and Fox Foundation.  ","The data provides several important concepts for combating the stigma of Tourette's Syndrome:

1. **Finding Humor in Tourette's**: Laughing at the unique and sometimes funny aspects of the syndrome can help break down the stigma. It's about acknowledging the humor in one's own tics and not laughing at others for being different.

2. **Breaking Stigma through Laughter**: Laughter is a powerful tool in reducing fear or anxiety associated with Tourette's. It helps in breaking down the fear people might feel towards those with the condition.

3. **Self-Acceptance and Understanding**: Hiding one's condition reinforces the stigma. It's important to embrace one's uniqueness and understand that there is nothing wrong with having Tourette's.

4. **Seeking Accommodations and Support**: Discussing disability accommodations with places where one's tics may be disruptive can help in reducing the stigma. Support from family, friends, and communities who understand Tourette's is crucial.

5. **Connecting with Others**: Joining support groups or finding others with Tourette's can provide understanding, acceptance, and a sense of community.

6. **Utilizing Unique Experiences**: People with Tourette's can use their condition to understand and connect with others better. Volunteering can be a way to contribute positively while also learning from others.

7. **Celebrating Uniqueness**: Instead of viewing Tourette's as a shameful disorder, embracing the uniqueness of the condition can lead to a more fulfilling life. Expressing oneself through art, dance, and other creative outlets can be therapeutic.

8. **Educating Yourself**: Researching Tourette's and being active in one's treatment plan can empower individuals to take control of their lives and challenge the stigma.

9. **Participating in Conferences**: Attending conferences for people with neurological conditions can provide valuable information, meet others with similar experiences, and learn strategies for living a fulfilling life despite the condition.

When you’re shopping for rice be sure to get one of the kinds that is not long-grain.Although it’s not impossible to use long-grain, it will not work as well as the shorter ones.; , Use a colander style sieve with holes that are small enough that the rice won’t fall through. Follow the instructions on the package of rice to measure out the amount you want to cook.If you use a rice cooker measuring cup, remember it is probably not a standard U.S. cup (237 ml). The package of rice and the rice cooker are likely to have different instructions for measuring the rice. Since the rice cooker is designed specifically, follow its directions over the rice package. Remember that rice expands as it cooks, so one uncooked cup of rice might be close to two cooked cups of rice.  , Grab a regular bowl, or basin of any kind, and set it under your faucet in the sink. As water strains through the rice and falls into the bowl, you’ll be able to gauge when the rice is completely rinsed.  , Turn the faucet on cold and begin to rinse the rice. This is necessary because packaged rice has lots of powdery starch in it. The rice needs to be washed completely so that it cooks up properly and doesn’t become too gooey.Cold water works best so that the rice doesn’t start cooking while you wash it. If you want to conserve water, just fill the bowl and set the sieve down into it. The rice won’t get as clean this way, but it will still rinse off most of the powder.  , Use your hands to gently massage and stir the rice so that each grain gets rinsed completely. Don’t press or squeeze the rice, as this will break the grains. As you rinse the rice, watch how the water in the bowl turns hazy from the powder.As you stir, look for any foreign objects that may have ended up in the rice. Most rice won’t have an excessive amount of non-rice, but it’s always good to check.  , When the water in the bowl is clear and not hazy, the rice is completely rinsed. Turn the water off and empty the bowl of rinse water., Set out a cookie sheet or some wax paper and pour the rice out on it. Spread it around with your hand so it forms a single layer and is not piled up. Leave the rice sitting to dry for about 15 minutes.If you are in a hurry, it’s not absolutely necessary to dry the rice, but it helps it cook better.  , Scoop the rice into a pile and begin transferring it from the drying surface into the rice cooker. Be sure you haven’t measured out more rice than your rice cooker can handle at one time. If any rice sticks to the sides, brush it down with the rest., If you used a standard U.S. measuring cup to measure the rice, rice preparation instructions typically call for an equal amount of water. If you used a cup that came with the rice cooker, follow the rice cooker directions for how much water to use.Rice cookers often have water fill lines, so if you used one rice cooker cup of rice, you’d fill to the line marked “1.” Never guess how much water the rice needs. Either follow the rice package instructions or follow the rice cooker instructions.  , Each rice cooker is different, but it is best to fill it with the rice and water before you plug it in. Otherwise it might start cooking before you are ready. If your rice cooker has multiple settings, consult the user manual. It may even have a setting for cooking sushi rice.   Be sure to set the rice cooker on a sturdy surface. Keep other objects away as heating elements always present a potential hazard.  , Close the lid on the rice cooker and leave it to cook the rice. You don’t need to stir the rice while it cooks, but pay attention to how long it needs to cook. This is determined more by the model of rice cooker you have than by anything else.   Your rice cooker may have a timer or an automatic shut-off, but if not, be sure to set a timer as directed by the rice package or the rice cooker instructions. Rice will overcook if you leave it in for too long.  , In a small bowl, combine ½ cup (118 ml) of rice vinegar (not any other kind of vinegar), two tablespoons (30 ml) of sugar, and two teaspoons (9.9 ml) of salt. Stir until the dry ingredients dissolve.These proportions are for three uncooked cups (710 ml) of rice. Adjust the proportions as needed for smaller or larger batches of rice. Seasoning comes down to preference, so you may want a stronger or weaker taste. If you don’t want to mix it yourself, look for bottled “Sushi Vinegar” at the grocery store.  , Scoop the rice out of the rice cooker into a large bowl. Pour the seasoning evenly over the rice. You may even want to add just a little of the seasoning at a time, mix it thoroughly, and taste it. Add more seasoning to your preference.  , Using a rice paddle or wide spatula, stir the rice gently so that the vinegar mixture coats every grain as evenly as possible. Mix for a few minutes to distribute it. As you mix the sushi rice, don’t smash the rice and try not to break the grains.,","1.

You might want to dig up the dirt a little, to help place them underground, and then fill the holes in around the stakes.To get the distance right, try balancing the bowl on the stakes ahead of time. See how far they need to be from each other to obtain optimal balance. When, you have found a good placement, mark the ground and begin hammering your branches in at that location., Place the bowl on top of the four stakes.

82," Shop around for the best Visa credit card offer., Consider co-signing for the credit card., Help your child apply for the credit card., Prepare for rejection., Reinforce good money management practices.",How to Get a Visa Credit Card for Your Kid1," Getting a credit card is just like shopping for anything else. You want the best deal.   Start by looking for cards with the lowest interest rate. The interest rate is effectively the ""price"" of the money that your child will be borrowing. The lower, the better. Also consider credit limit. It may be the case that a credit card with a low-interest rate also has an unacceptably low credit limit. Look for a card that strikes the right balance. Keep in mind that some banks might require your child to have an account with the bank before offering a credit card. Decide on whether you think it's worth it for your child to open an account just to get a Visa card.; , If you have excellent credit, you might give your child a good shot at getting a Visa card by co-signing for it. Of course, you'll be responsible if your child doesn't pay the amount that's due every month. You already know if your child has good character, so decide if you want to assume the risk accordingly.   Keep in mind that not all credit card issuers allow for co-signers., Once you've found what you think is the best deal, you should assist your child in applying for the credit card. Since it's a first-time experience, your son or daughter will undoubtedly have questions.  , It's often the case that younger people who apply for a credit card for the first time are rejected. Usually, that's because there's not enough credit history, even after following the steps above. Reassure your child that rejection is common for young people and move on to another offer.  , If the card is approved, remind your child about the importance of maintaining a good credit history if he or she ever wants to buy a house or a new car. Let your child know that it's important to pay credit card bills on time all the time.  ","1. **Comparison Shopping**: Treating the process of getting a credit card like shopping for any other item is crucial. It involves comparing different offers to find the best deal.

2. **Interest Rate**: The interest rate is the most important factor to consider. A lower interest rate means borrowing money is cheaper in the long run.

3. **Credit Limit**: The credit limit should be balanced with the interest rate. A low interest rate with a high credit limit is ideal, but it may not always be available.

4. **Bank Account Requirement**: Some banks may require your child to have an account with the bank before offering a credit card.

5. **Co-Signing**: If your child has excellent credit, you can co-sign for the credit card. This makes it easier for your child to get a Visa card, but you'll be responsible if your child doesn't pay.

6. **Assuming Risk**: You should only co-sign if you're willing to take on the risk of your child's creditworthiness.

7. **Application Assistance**: After finding the best deal, assist your child in applying for the credit card. They will likely have questions, and you can help them through the process.

8. **Rejection and Persistence**: It's common for first-time credit card applicants to be rejected due to insufficient credit history. Encourage your child to apply again with the same or improved qualifications.

9. **Importance of Good Credit History**: Remind your child of the long-term benefits of maintaining a good credit history, such as better chances of securing loans for major purchases like houses or cars.

You will need two different shoelaces in separate colors for this lacing style, but the two laces should be equal in length. You should select flat shoelaces that are fairly thin. Each eyelet will need to hold two layers of shoelace, so it is important that the shoelaces you choose are thin and flat, regardless of length.This lacing technique can be used on Converse with an odd number of eyelet pairs, but it will look most symmetrical with shoes that have an even number of pairs. If using two pairs of eyelets, choose shoelace 28 inches (71 cm) long. If using three pairs of eyelets, choose shoelaces 32 inches (81 cm) in length. If using four pairs of eyelets, choose shoelaces 36 inches (92 cm) long. If using five pairs of eyelets, use shoelaces 40 inches (102 cm) in length. If using six pairs of eyelets, use shoelaces 44 inches (113 cm) long. If using seven pairs of eyelets, use shoelaces 48 inches (123 cm) in length. If using eight pairs of eyelets, choose laces 53 inches (134 cm) long.  , Arrange the two shoelaces so that they are evenly lined up and back-to-back. You should have, in appearance, a flat shoelace with double thickness and two sides. Note that this technique is fairly similar to the criss-cross lacing technique and uses the same general pattern. This is a popular lacing style for converse because it is fun, decorative, and easy to customize. It is slightly harder to tighten and tie than a single-lace method, however, so you should be aware of this fact before choosing this technique.        , Pull the double-laces through the bottom set of eyelets so that ""Color One"" shows. The other lace, ""Color Two,"" should be hidden behind the top lace. The shoelaces should be threaded into the eyelets from the bottom so that the ends come up through the eyelets. The ends should drape over the eyelet sides once this step is completed.        , Pull ""Side A"" out of the bottom left eyelet and through the second-to-bottom right eyelet. Make sure that the shoelaces are twisted so that ""Color Two"" is now on top while ""Color One"" is hidden on the bottom. A diagonal line should connect the bottom and second-to-bottom holes on opposing sides of the Converse. Pull the laces from the underside of the right second-to-bottom hole and over the top.        , Pull ""Side B"" out of the bottom right eyelet and through the second-to-bottom left eyelet. The shoelaces should be twisted to match the other half of the criss-cross. ""Color Two"" should show on the top and ""Color One"" should be hidden on the bottom. The two eyelets should be connected by a diagonal line. Pull the shoelaces through the left eyelet from the underside, letting them drape over the top of the left eyelet once you pull them through.        , Then repeat the crossing procedure. Repeat the criss-crossing pattern, but twist the shoelaces so that Color One is now on top while Color Two is now hidden on the bottom. Alternate ""Side A"" and ""Side B"" back and forth, criss-crossing the eyelets so that each end is pulled through its eyelet and into the eyelet on the opposite side one row up.        , Continue twisting and criss-crossing the shoelaces. Each ""x"" across your shoes should be composed of a single color, but each ""x"" should be the opposite color of the ""x"" beneath it and above it.        , When you pull the shoelaces through the top set of eyelets, it does not matter which side of the double-lace shows. Both sides will show when you tie your shoes. Alternatively, you can make tying the shoes easier by tucking one color shoelace into the top of your shoe and only tying the other color in the front of your shoe. Otherwise, you will tie your shoes using both laces.        ","1. **Shoelace Length Dependence on Eyelet Pairs**: The length of the shoelaces needed depends on the number of eyelet pairs on your Converse shoes. For two pairs, use 28 inches; for three pairs, 32 inches; for four pairs, 36 inches; for five pairs, 40 inches; for six pairs, 44 inches; for seven pairs, 48 inches; and for eight pairs, 53 inches.

2. **Choosing Thin, Flat Shoelaces**: Select shoelaces that are thin and flat, regardless of length, as each eyelet will need to hold two layers of shoelace.

3. **Lacing Style for Converse Shoes**: This lacing technique is suitable for Converse shoes with an even number of eyelet pairs and can be used with an odd number, but it will look most symmetrical with even pairs.

4. **Arranging and Lining Up Shoelaces**: Arrange the two shoelaces so that they are evenly lined up and back-to-back, creating a double-thickness appearance.

5. **Positioning Shoelaces**: Start by having ""Color One"" showing at the bottom and ""Color Two"" hidden behind. The ends of the laces should drape over the eyelet sides.

6. **Creating the Criss-Cross Pattern**:
   - Pull ""Side A"" through the bottom left eyelet and the second-to-bottom right eyelet, ensuring the shoelaces are twisted so that ""Color Two"" is on top and ""Color One"" is hidden.
   - Pull ""Side B"" through the bottom right eyelet and the second-to-bottom left eyelet, twisting the shoelaces to match the other half of the criss-cross pattern.
   - Continue criss-crossing the eyelets, alternating ""Side A"" and ""Side B"", ensuring each end is pulled through its eyelet and into the eyelet on the opposite side one row up.

7. **Maintaining Color Pattern**: Each ""x"" across your shoes should be composed of a single color, but each ""x"" should be the opposite color of the ""x"" beneath it and above it.

8. **Tying the Shoes**: When pulling the shoelaces through the top set of eyelets, it does not matter which side shows. Both sides will show when tying the shoes. Alternatively, you can make tying easier by tucking one shoelace into the top of the shoe and only tying the other in the front.

84," Deal with impostor syndrome., Remember that racist comments are not about you., Release the stress of being a cultural “representative”., Be informed., Use humor., Find similarities with those around you.",How to Feel Normal if You're from a Different Race1," Impostor syndrome occurs when you believe that your abilities are not up to par as those around you. You may believe you received a scholarship or a job offer because of your race, somehow making you less qualified than those around you. You may try to overachieve as a result of feeling “not good enough” or feel great dissatisfaction or guilt in your studies or profession. You may fear the day the “truth” comes out and people believe you are a fraud. It’s important to recognize that you have value for your own characteristics and achievements.Be aware when feelings of being an impostor come up. Understand the difference between reality and feelings. When feelings come up, use the statement, “Even if I feel undeserving, it doesn’t mean I really am.” If you feel like an impostor, know that you are not alone. Even some high achieving individuals suffer from impostor syndrome. Remind yourself that you work hard and deserve the things you have.; , Remember that racist comments reflect a problem with the person who holds those beliefs, not you. Experiencing prejudice or discrimination does not automatically make you less valuable or mean there is anything wrong with you.It’s important to feel empowered by who you are and not “less than” other people.[   If you do experience prejudice or discrimination, take it seriously. Report the prejudice to someone who can help. For example, school bullies might exclude you from participating in a social group due to your race, or they might call you hurtful names.These are both actions that should be reported to a parent, teacher, counselor, or another figure of authority. You do not deserve this treatment, and you don't have to put up with it.  , If you are a minority in a group of people racially different than you, don’t feel pressure to represent your race.You may feel like people have negative associations with those in your racial group, and you want to prove them wrong. Remember that you can’t change people’s judgments, no matter how hard you try. There is great variation within your race, and you cannot represent everyone as one person.   Don’t allow people to see you as a representative, either. Remind people that while stereotypes exist, everyone is unique and not to judge a whole group by one person.  , When faced with discriminatory comments, be ready to fire back. This can be empowering for you to have a response and to use information as power.When faced with insensitive comments or racism, be ready with events, facts, or statistics that help you educate people that may be less aware of how these comments affect people.   When people are overtly ignorant about other groups, you can help them understand it better. Even a comment like, “When you put Chinese people down, it perpetuates a mentality of them being less than you” is helpful. You can also say, ""When you say that Black people are better at sports, you're essentializing a whole group of people, which isn't fair."" You can also use the power of facts in your favor. For example, if someone makes a remark about how immigrants hurt the community, you can reply that immigrants often own small businesses and contribute to the economy.Or, if someone has said that immigrants are ""criminals,"" you can tell them that immigrants are much less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens., When experiencing stress related to race, empower yourself to not back down. While some people may fire back, you may take a lighter stance by adding a bit of humor to the situation. Especially if you are within a group of friends and someone says something offensive, say something light and funny, yet still makes a point. Using humor can be a bridge to talk about an uncomfortable topic but in a more approachable way. You can say, “""Well, my girlfriend is Indian, and I haven't noticed that with her... should I call her and ask her if that's true?"" or ""That's a cool joke, can you tell it to my Nigerian friend? Do you think he'd like it?""  , It may be easy to see how you differ from those around you, but challenge yourself to see the similarities between yourself and those you feel different from.Remember that underneath all the cultural and physical differences, we share more similarities than differences because we are all human.   As humans, we all feel fear, joy, nervousness, pain, excitement, betrayal, and love. Even when you feel different, remember that despite cultural differences, we have experiential similarities that make us all human. Find activities that you enjoy, and share them with a group. This could be joining a sport team, taking a sewing class, or engaging in any activity that you can enjoy with other people.  ","The most important concepts from the provided data are:

An amplifier increases the power available to your speakers while a preamplifier controls everything and needs both an amplifier and speaker to function.A tube amp uses a vacuum tube where a single ended triode tube amp works well with high efficiency speakers. FET amp stands for Field Effect Transistor because it uses an electric field. This type of amp is a popular solid state amp. Class A amps produce almost no distortion with a maximum amount of power. Class B amps produce some distortion and need to be turned on. Class AB amps are a combination of Class A and B where a signal switches between a Class A and B circuit.  , Amplifiers have many different configurations that can be based on the number of speakers, type of speakers, and room configuration.   If you’re simply using a pair of speakers, stereo amps are a common choice. If you have a number of different high powered speakers, monoblock amps can be setup for each. If your home theater is advanced with five inputs or more, multichannel amps are best.  , Your equipment will depend on how involved your home theater will be but the basic requirements are the input sources, amplifiers, preamplifiers, and cable connectors.Input sources are whatever you choose to plug into your speakers including Blu-Ray players, DVD players, and stereos. Cable connectors should come with input sources but if you need more or need extended lengths, go to your local home theater specialist.  , Your preamp should be easily accessible with space for both input and output cables.If you’re using a home theater cabinet, make sure there is an opening in the back or remove any covering that can obstruct your cables.  , Depending on how many input sources you have, you may need to label each cable. Keep your cables organized as you connect them to your preamp.Wrap masking tape near the plug of the connector and label each source.  , Run cables from the back of your input devices to input plugs in your preamplifier.   Ensure that you’re using the right cable and are connecting it to the right input plug in the preamp as there can be many plugs. Ensure that the plug is firmly connected to the slot.  , Connect cables from the output terminals of your preamp to input plugs at the back of your amplifier. Your amplifier will be connected to your speakers via the output terminals.Do not connect a two channel amp to more than two speakers because it will damage your amp.  , Choose your input source and turn on your amplifier and preamplifier. Never connect your amplifier while the power is on as it will create a power surge and, depending on your volume control, a nasty sound.While any amp can be used with any preamp, they can also come as a single integrated unit. The difference between a single unit and a 2-piece combination is the flexibility you have when setting up your home theater and the power you can have available to you.  ","1. **Home Theater Components**: The key components in a home theater setup include amplifiers, preamplifiers, input sources, and cable connectors.

2. **Amplifiers and Preamplifiers**: The choice between an amplifier and preamplifier depends on the desired sound and budget. An amplifier increases power for speakers, while a preamplifier controls inputs and outputs.

3. **Amplifier Configurations**: Amplifiers can be configured based on the number of speakers, type of speakers, and room configuration. Stereo amps are for simple setups, monoblock amps for high-powered speakers, and multichannel amps for advanced home theaters with multiple inputs.

4. **Input Sources**: These include devices like Blu-Ray players, DVD players, and stereos, providing audio and video content for the home theater.

5. **Cable Connectors and Preamp Accessibility**: Preamp should have space for input and output cables, and cable organization is crucial for proper connections.

86," Reduce distance!, When you have the gun, back up quickly., Tap, rack, activate and aim., Pointing a loaded gun at a floored opponent should end the confrontation, enabling you to walk away.",How to Disarm Your Opponent2," Guns are effective at extended ranges, so it is essential to reduce distance if attacked with a firearm. Each of these techniques can be adapted for pistols and also long rifles.   If the attacker is pointing the gun at your face, it is essential to redirect the line of fire upwards to reduce the chance of collateral damage. Do so by placing the balls of your hands together and making a V with your hands. Your fingers should remain spread, however, to ensure that you can grasp the gun. Remember that your opponent is expecting some sort of reaction, so try to fuse this with a feigned raising of your arms. Grasp the barrel of the gun from underneath with the aforementioned V hand positioning. Do not grab the handle or your opponent's hands. Push up and then quickly pull down. As you pull down, step in and push your hands forward to crank the opponent's wrist back and point the gun vertically. Kick the knees or groin to disconnect your opponent. You are also in a position to twist the gun sideways. Doing so, and then quickly pulling back should force your opponent to release the gun by hyper extending the thumb.       For a gun pointed to the chest, the defense is the same as for a knife thrust to the chest. The choke hold is particularly useful here as an arm bar may be hazardous.       If the gun is aimed to the back of the head, rapidly turning into the attacker will result in his arm being next to your head. Clamp it down and finish with knee strikes to the groin, bladder, and liver, and palm strikes to the head.       If the gun is behind you, glance over your shoulder. Your opponent will be expecting this reaction. Turn and use your hips to push the arm towards the assailant's line of symmetry. Finish as in the first example.        , Create distance.  , Tap the magazine well to ensure that it is properly seated, pull back on the feeding slide to insert a fresh round and clear any jam that may have resulted from the struggle. Check the safety and aim the gun with both hands.   If the gun is a revolver, pull the hammer back into single action mode because some revolvers are single action only. Also, the trigger pull will be lessened, making a reflex shot easier.        , However, if you must fire, fire two reflexive shots to the chest with minimal effective aiming followed by a single shot to the head with careful aiming.   If you must fire while backing up, (before the tap, rack, aim) fire from the hip. Clamp the gun against your hip, being sure to lower the shoulder so that the slide doesn't hit your forearm. Stand with the gun-side foot back.        ","The most important concepts from the provided data are:

1. **Reducing Distance**: When attacked with a firearm, the key is to minimize distance between yourself and the attacker. This is crucial for reducing the effectiveness of the gun's range.

2. **Handling Gun**: To defend against a gun pointed at you, it's essential to redirect the line of fire upwards without touching the handle or the attacker's hands. Use a V-like hand positioning with the fingers spread to grasp the barrel, and then execute a specific sequence of actions to disarm the attacker.

3. **Defense Against Different Gun Positions**:
   - **Gun pointed at the face**: Redirect the barrel upwards and use a feigned reaction to disarm.
   - **Gun pointed at the chest**: Use a choke hold or redirect the barrel upwards, then follow with knee strikes and palm strikes.
   - **Gun pointed at the head**: Clamp the gun and use knee strikes to the groin, bladder, and liver, followed by palm strikes to the head.
   - **Gun pointed behind**: Turn into the attacker, push the arm towards the assailant's line of symmetry, and then disarm as in the first example.

4. **Distance Creation**: If you find yourself in close proximity to an attacker with a gun, create distance immediately. This can be achieved by physically moving away or by using distractions to draw the attacker's attention away from you.

5. **Gun Safety and Aiming**: Before firing, ensure the gun is properly loaded, cleared of jams, and the safety is on. For revolvers, pull the hammer back into single action mode for easier trigger pull. When firing, aim for the chest first (two shots) and then the head (one shot), using a defensive stance if possible. If you must fire while backing up, aim from the hip to minimize accuracy requirements.

6. **Emergency Action**: If all else fails and you must fire, take a defensive stance and fire reflexively at the chest, followed by a single shot to the head. This approach minimizes the need for precise aiming and is suitable for defensive situations.

7. **Post-Disarm Techniques**: After successfully disarming the attacker, create distance and ensure the gun is out of reach. Immediately address any injuries and seek medical help if necessary.

These concepts provide a comprehensive approach to defending against an armed attacker, emphasizing the importance of distance, hand positioning, and strategic disarmament techniques.",7.76955282946946e-232,0.09345794392523366,0.023474178403755867,0.07009345794392524,0.7903500199317932,0.8454197645187378,0.8169578909873962,0.13215859030837007

Decide on what you are comfortable with.; , Christmas presents should figure into your household or personal budget for the entire year, instead of just trying to find extra money somehow every November or December. You can always start by saving a small amount every month.   Keep a general idea of how much you will spend on each person. For instance, you will likely spend more money on your immediate family than on a co-worker.  , What do they like? Movies, books, games? Have a rough idea of what presents would please the people on your list. brainstorm ideas. Write the ideas down on your list. Listen to the person or other people for ideas, and write them down too. Keep this list in an easy-to-carry form, like tucked away in your wallet or checkbook for quick reference.  , There's no point in buying early if you're going to buy for full price. Christmas shopping can start December 26th. Although you may feel the last thing you want to do is shop after the Christmas rush, stores often have incredible sales immediately after the holidays, and most items will be perfectly good gifts the next year.   Check out sales throughout the year, such as at the end of summer. After-Christmas and Boxing Day sales are a good time to pick up wrapping paper and the like for the next year for a pittance.  , Many people end up shopping last-minute because they put off the inevitable. Instead, make a plan with solid goals, dates, and timelines.   For instance, shopping will be done by December 20th. Put aside two evenings, twice a week for 2 weeks to accomplish this task. Leave some wiggle-room in case something comes up, but don't keep making excuses. It can help to have someone who is good about shopping to keep you on track.  , Maybe you're not the type of person who likes shopping, or don't have the time to browse for Christmas presents all year long. Instead, put aside one period of time, like a weekend or a special shopping trip.  , Don't lose the present or forget who you bought it for.   Have a designated area for presents, such as a tote, section of closet, or attic. Be sure that the present won't be ruined by variations of temperature, humidity, mold, mice, and so on. Write the name of the designated gift-receiver on a removable sticker or piece of tape. That way you'll remember who you bought it for. If you change your mind, it's easy to re-designate. Cross their name off the list as soon as possible to avoid forgetting that you already bought them something.  , Hiding is the hardest part of buying a gift early, but it's perfectly possible. If you live with the person, hide it in your craft cupboard, toy box, the back of a wardrobe, etc. and leave it inside backpacks or other opaque bags. It's best to choose somewhere the other person is not likely to look.  ","1. Consider the extent to which you are comfortable shopping for various people, including family, friends, and acquaintances.
2. Allocate a portion of your household or personal budget for Christmas presents throughout the year, rather than trying to find extra money only in November or December.
3. Determine the amount you will spend on each person and consider their preferences (e.g., movies, books, games) to choose suitable gifts.
4. Keep a list of gift ideas and keep it accessible, such as in your wallet or checkbook.

88," Start by learning to count to five., Learn the numbers for six through ten., Put it all together to count to ten., Memorize the numbers 11 through 15., Study the numbers 16 through 19., Count in tens., Understand how to form other numbers., Review basic accentuation rules., Watch TV shows or movies in Spanish., Listen to Spanish music., Talk to native speakers.",How to Count up to 10 in Spanish," It may be easier for you to learn how to count to ten (and beyond!) if you split the numbers into chunks. Memorizing shorter sequences is easier than trying to learn all the numbers at once. Repeat the words until you can say them without thinking.Although not typically included in counting, you can say zero in Spanish as cero (SAY-roh). One in Spanish is uno (OO-noh). Two in Spanish is dos (doss). Three in Spanish is tres (tress). Four in Spanish is cuatro (KWA-tro). Five in Spanish is cinco (SEEN-ko).; , Once you've committed the Spanish words for numbers one through five to memory, you're ready to move on to the next set of numbers. Repeat the new numbers over and over until you know them as well as you know one through five.Six in Spanish is seis (SAISS). Seven in Spanish is siete (SYE-te). Eight in Spanish is ocho (O-cho). Nine in Spanish is nueve (NWAI-be). Ten in Spanish is diez (DYESS).  , When you have both sets of numbers memorized, all you have to do is put them in a single series and say them all together. You now know how to count up to 10 in Spanish.Count to ten repeatedly until the words are automatic for you. One way to incorporate the Spanish words into your every day life is to try to automatically think of the Spanish word for the number when you're looking at a number of items. For example, if you have a bowl of fruit in your kitchen that has two apples, three bananas, and seven oranges, you might think to yourself that there are dos apples, tres bananas, and siete oranges. It doesn't matter whether you know the Spanish words for those fruits.  , There's no point in stopping once you've learned to count up to 10 in Spanish. Using the same strategy you did when you learned to count to ten, learn the Spanish words for the numbers 11 through 15. The Spanish language has unique words for these numbers.For 11, say once (OHN-say). For 12, say doce (DOH-say). For 13, say trece (TRAY-say). For 14, say catorce (kah-TOHR-say). For 15, say quince (KEEN-say).  , When you learn numbers 16 through 19, you're also learning how all the other numbers in Spanish are formed. You'll take the word for 10, diez, include an ee sound (""y"" in Spanish means ""and""), and then the word for the second digit.16 is dieciséis (DYEESS-ee-SAYSS). 17 is diecisiete (DYEESS-ee-SYAY-tay). 18 dieciocho (DYEESS-ee-OH-choh). 19 is diecinueve (DYEESS-ee-NWAY-bay).  , To figure out how to form other numbers in Spanish, you'll have to memorize the base numbers by learning how to count in tens. These number words are the building blocks for saying larger numbers in Spanish.For 20, say veinte (BAYN-tay). For 30, say treinta (TRAYN-tah). For 40, say cuarenta (kwah-RAYN-tah). For 50, say cincuenta (seen-KWAYN-tah). For 60, say sesenta (say-SAYN-tah). For 70, say setenta (say-TAYN-tah). For 80, say ochenta (oh-CHAYN-tah). For 90, say noventa (noh-BAYN-tah).  , Now that you know how to count to 10, and you know how to count in tens, you can easily combine your knowledge to say or write in Spanish any number up to 99.Keep in mind that the spelling may differ, and you may need to stress different syllables. However, if you understand the basics of how numbers are formed, you can at least recognize any number you see or hear in Spanish. As with everything else, remember to practice this skill regularly and repeat the numbers to yourself at least once every few days. Over time, counting in Spanish will become second nature to you.  , In Spanish, if you see an accent mark over a letter, it tells you that you are supposed to stress or emphasize that syllable when you pronounce the word. Some Spanish words are spelled the same way, but mean entirely different things depending on which syllable is stressed.The essential accentuation rule in Spanish is that if the word ends in a vowel, an n, or an s, you'll put stress on the next to last syllable. With any other word, you'll stress the last syllable. However, if the word has an accent mark, you stress that syllable and ignore the general rule. For example, in your numbers, you may have noticed an accent in the word for 16, dieciséis. This means that you should stress the last syllable, despite the fact that it ends with an s.   , Listening to people speak Spanish can help you understand more about how the words fit together and how they're said in the context of normal conversation.Actors typically pronounce their words without excessive regional dialect – unless the show or movie takes place in a specific geographic area. This makes it easier for you to learn the language. Keep in mind that Spanish is spoken in many countries all over the world, giving rise to multiple dialects and variations. Even for a native speaker, someone from another country can be difficult to understand.  , Music can be an easy way to learn a language because of the rhythm and repetitiveness of the lyrics. If you find music with Spanish lyrics that appeals to you, listening to it on a regular basis can help you understand how words are pronounced.If you think back to how you learned your first language, you'll probably recall that there was a lot of music involved. Songs are a very efficient way to learn words and how they fit together. You may not understand exactly what something means, but the important part when you're just beginning to learn Spanish is to listen to the way the words are pronounced and how the language sounds.  , When you're learning any no language, there's nothing better to enhance your understanding of the language and the way the words are spoken than to talk to people who are fluent in the language.Native speakers also can correct your pronunciation and give you tips on how to pronounce the words correctly. Particularly if you have another language in common, a native speaker may be able to give you tips on how to pronounce words in Spanish that you wouldn't have picked up on otherwise.  ","1. **Chunking Numbers**: Splitting numbers into smaller, more manageable chunks makes it easier to memorize them.

   - 80: ochenta (oh-CHAYN-tah)
   - 90: noventa (noh-BAYN-tah)

5. **Accentuation in Spanish**:
   - If a word ends in a vowel, n, or s, stress the syllable before the last. Otherwise, stress the last syllable. Words with an acute accent mark stress the syllable after the mark.

6. **Listening and Practice**:
   - Listening to native speakers can improve pronunciation and understanding of the language's rhythm and intonation.
   - Music with Spanish lyrics can be a helpful tool for learning pronunciation and rhythm.
   - Speaking with native speakers allows for immediate feedback on pronunciation and provides tips for correct pronunciation.

7. **Building on Base Numbers**:
   - Once you know numbers 1-10, learn how to count in tens (20, 30, 40, etc.) to form larger numbers.
   - Combine these base numbers with the numbers 1-10 to say any number up to 99.

8. **Staying Consistent**:
   - Regular practice and repetition are key to making numbers in Spanish automatic and second nature.

Common causes of transmission include:Sexual contact with an infected partner. Transmission can occur via blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and saliva. Transmission through infected needles. This includes people who may be sharing needles for intravenous drug use and it includes health care workers who may be at risk of accidental needle sticks. Transmission during childbirth. If the mother is infected, she may transmit it to her infant during birth. However, if the mother knows that she is infected, the infant can be vaccinated upon birth.; , If you think you may have been exposed to hepatitis B, see a doctor immediately. If you receive care within 12 hours, it may prevent the infection. You doctor will likely do the following:Give you an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin to boost your immune response Vaccinate you against hepatitis B  , Symptoms usually start one to four months after the initial exposure. Symptoms may include:Abdominal pain Dark urine Fever Joint pain Not being hungry Vomiting and nausea Feeling weak and tired Jaundice (your skin and the whites of your eyes turn yellowish)  , The doctor may do several tests.The doctor will confirm the presence of the virus with a blood test and whether it is acute or chronic. The doctor might also do a liver biopsy to see if you have liver damage. This involves removing a very small piece of liver tissue through a thin needle and analyzing the tissue in the lab.  , Most cases of hepatitis B are acute. Acute cases of hepatitis B, contrary to what the name might suggest, are infections that will go away on their own. 95% of cases will clear on their own and the illness illness typically goes away within a few weeks and liver function is normal within six months. Treatment is usually not indicated in the acute stage.   Get plenty of bed rest, drink lots of fluids, and stick with healthy foods. This will help your body clear the virus efficiently.If you are in pain, discuss what painkillers your doctor recommends, even for over the counter medications (acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen) or herbal supplements. You don’t want to take anything that will be hard on your liver.Schedule follow-up blood tests with your doctor to track the natural course of the infection. These blood tests will help your doctor determine whether the virus is being cleared. If your liver is becoming damaged, your doctor may recommend lamivudine (Epivir)., If your body has not cleared the virus within a few months, you may have chronic hepatitis B. Your doctor is likely to prescribe medications if you show the following symptoms:High virus levels in your blood Decreasing liver function Signs of long-term liver damage and scarring (cirrhosis)  , There are several possibilities depending upon your age and circumstances.Antiviral medications can reduce the viral load in your body. Possibilities include lamivudine (Epivir), adefovir (Hepsera), telbivudine (Tyzeka) and entecavir (Baraclude). These medications will slow the progression of the disease and decrease your chances of sustaining liver damage.Interferon-alpha is a medication which contains a synthetic version of the protein your body makes to fight the virus. This option is often given to younger people who may want to become pregnant in the next few years and do not want to have a long treatment process. However, it has significant side effects including depression, anxiety, flu-like symptoms, breathing problems, a tight feeling in the chest, and hair loss.Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues are substances that prevent the virus from replicating. Some well known ones include adefovir (Hepsera), entecavir (Baraclude), lamivudine (Epivir-HBV, Heptovir, Heptodin), telbivudine (Tyzeka) and tenofovir (Viread). However, these medications have a serious drawback in that the virus may mutate and develop resistance to these drugs after several years of use., If necessary a surgeon can remove your liver and replace it with a healthy one.   Sometimes a piece of a healthy liver from a living donor may be used.  , Even though medications can reduce the number of viruses in the blood to nearly zero, low numbers of the virus still live in the liver and elsewhere.Monitor yourself for resurgences of the disease and if you feel the symptoms returning, go to the doctor immediately. Ask your doctor what he or she recommends for long-term follow up.  , It won’t spread through casual contact, but it could through the exchange of bodily fluids.Be open with your partner and encourage him or her to get tested and vaccinated. Use a condom during sex to reduce the risk of transmission. Don’t share needles, syringes, razors or toothbrushes, all of which could have small amounts of infected blood on them.  , This includes alcohol, recreational drugs, and over the counter drugs or supplements.Alcohol itself can damage the liver, so you should abstain from drinking alcohol to protect your liver while your body fights the infection. Avoid recreational drugs which may cause liver damage. Ask your doctor which over the counter medications you can take for mild conditions like a cold, flu, or headache. Even over the counter medications may burden your liver when it is in a damaged or vulnerable state.  , You will not infect friends through casual contact and the social support is important for your psychological and physical health.   Seek out support groups for people with liver disease.Remind yourself that with appropriate treatment and monitoring, the prognosis for people with hepatitis B is usually very good.  ","1.

Put on a nice suit, shave, and use some perfume if you're a woman.; , Take a lot of time practicing tasks such as parking a big car in a tight car park or parking spot, gently accelerating/turning and braking the ""chauffeur"" car. Get familiar with the car you will be using.  , Below are some examples:   If you chauffeur your kids or friends around everyday, you probably don't need any special transportation vehicle; your daily family car will fit the deal. If you chauffeur your wife/girlfriend/mother for the weekend in short distances, your daily family car will fit the deal perfectly once more. If you are going on a longer trip and you have a car that belongs to the ""touring"" car category, such as BMW 5/7 series, an Audi A6/A8, or a Mercedes E/S class, or this type of vehicle, prefer this one because they have a more comfortable ride. They offer a good variety of equipment whether it is for safety, comfort or entertainment.  , If you are planning to buy another car to be the chauffeur car, look at your needs and the available budget first.   For a low to medium budget there is lots of cars out there that are very comfortable, safe, and built to ""eat"" kilometers/miles. Search brands that have a long history record on luxury cruisers, because these companies know how to build very good cruisers. If you have a medium to high budget, consider cars such as BMW 7 Series, Audi A8, Mercedes S Class, Lexus LS Series, etc. If you have a budget that is higher than the average high budget, consider a GT (Gran Turismo), or category cars such as the Aston Martin Rapide, Aston Martin DB9, Bentley Continental Flying Spur, Bentley Mulsanne, Ferrari 612 Scaglietti, Ferrari FF, etc. Remember there are thousands of good condition used luxury or hyper-luxury cars that are the bargains of the century.  , The car that is used should always be as clean as possible, fully filled up with gas, and well maintained so that it won't break down or do strange noises during the drive. It's also important to do the regular checks such as fluid level, tyre pressure, and other everyday maintenance.  , A typical greeting (as you would always greet them) is okay. If you will also have somebody in the car who is a stranger for you or someone much older than you, make a gentleman greeting and open the door for him. If you chauffeur someone with high reputation (you will probably be a chauffeur for a living in this option) greet them again as a gentleman and open the door for him.  , Try to drive at the speed of the traffic flow and avoid constant overtaking. Be sure to stop gently and also drive off gently. When overtaking. Try not to accelerate too hard or floor it because high speeds could scare some passengers.   A V8 is good entry level engine, as it has good low end and medium end torque, so you don't have to downshift or accelerate too hard. The V12 engine is the boss in these cars because it has a lot of torque, so you almost don't need to downshift. You just have to press a bit more on the accelerator. V12 engines also are extremely smooth and quiet in the way they deliver both power and torque. If you are chauffeuring your family and friends, you can show them what your V8 Charger or Bi-Turbo V12 S600 can do, but avoid doing that when you are transporting a stranger. You can accelerate a bit more quickly from time to time and, if you see that he/she likes it, then it's okay if you drive a bit faster, especially if it is going to make the ride a bit more exciting. However, you should still always obey traffic laws and never break the speed limit.  , If you transfer your family/friends stop as close to your destination as possible, let them get off the car so you don't have to carry them with you while searching for an empty parking spot.
