The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967.

The tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the Augustan regime, while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty. Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the Augustan regime, and some scholars see strong associations between Augustus and Aeneas, the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome. A strong teleology, or drive towards a climax, has been detected in the poem. The Aeneid is full of prophecies about the future of Rome, the deeds of Augustus, his ancestors, and famous Romans, and the Carthaginian Wars; the shield of Aeneas even depicts Augustus' victory at Actium against Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII in 31 BC. A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas.

Some of these, such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear, or can be assumed to be linear, and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of the capacitor. The usual methods of network analysis can then be applied. In other cases, such as with breakdown voltage, the effect is non-linear and normal (i.e., linear) network analysis cannot be used, the effect must be dealt with separately. There is yet another group, which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant. Such an example is temperature dependence. Finally, combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance, resistance, or dielectric losses can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation.","Upon dealing with leakage current and parasitic effects in a realistic model of a capacitor, what sort of methods can then be applied?","{'text': array(['The usual methods of network analysis'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([275], dtype=int32)}","Upon dealing with leakage current and parasitic effects in a realistic model of a capacitor, the usual methods of network analysis, such as nodal analysis, mesh analysis, or the use of Thevenin's and Norton's theorems, can be applied after adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit to account for these non-ideal behaviors."

Mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the Remington No. 2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of 23456789- were ""#$%_&'() –  early typewriters omitted 0 and 1, using O (capital letter o) and l (lowercase letter L) instead, but 1! and 0) pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common.

The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing _ (underscore) from 6 and shifting the remaining characters left, which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with 8 and 9. This discrepancy from typewriters led to bit-paired keyboards, notably the Teletype Model 33, which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, not to traditional mechanical typewriters. Electric typewriters, notably the more recently introduced IBM Selectric (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers—​​following the IBM PC (1981), especially Model M (1984)—​​and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did.

In the context of the ASCII table, the shift values for non-alphanumeric characters are influenced by the design of mechanical typewriters. Specifically, the shift values for symbols such as #, $, and % were influenced by the layout of the Remington No. 2 typewriter, which was the first to include a shift key. This typewriter's layout led to the placement of these symbols in the second column, rows 1–5, corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent column. However, since the space character occupied the position for the digit 0, the underscore (_) was removed from the character 6, and the remaining characters were shifted left. This layout was adopted by many European typewriters, which placed parentheses with the digits 8 and 9.


The Teletype Model 33, a bit-paired keyboard, used a layout that corresponded to the ASCII table rather than traditional mechanical typewriters. This layout influenced the design of modern keyboards, especially those following the IBM PC and its Model M.


The ASCII table also rearranged the semicolon (;) and colon (:) symbols, which had varied conventions on earlier typewriters, and it standardized mathematical symbols such as -* and ;+.


In summary, the shift values for non-alphanumeric characters in the ASCII table were influenced by the mechanical typewriter designs, particularly the Remington No. 2, and the layouts of early electric typewriters like the IBM Selectric."
572ed638dfa6aa1500f8d431,Elevator,"Statistically speaking, cable-borne elevators are extremely safe. Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system. In 1998, it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open. Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related — for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts, and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors. In fact, prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring (though not killing) the sole occupant — the elevator operator. However, there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children's hospital, where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged. This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping (or, in this case, a free-fall). While it is possible (though extraordinarily unlikely) for an elevator's cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing. An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in high rise installations) hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight. In addition, there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed; if this happens, the device causes copper (or silicon nitride in high rise installations) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft, stopping the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called the governor, and was invented by Elisha Graves Otis. In addition, a oil/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil/hydraulic buffer or a combination (depending on the travel height and travel speed) is installed at the bottom of the shaft (or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft) to somewhat cushion any impact.

Such chalets are typically found in the higher parts of the valleys, as in the Maurienne valley in Savoy, where the amount of snow during the cold months is important. The inclination of the roof cannot exceed 40%, allowing the snow to stay on top, thereby functioning as insulation from the cold. In the lower areas where the forests are widespread, wooden tiles are traditionally used. Commonly made of Norway spruce, they are called ""tavaillon"".

This phase is the first phase, or ""primary phase,"" to form in the Al-Fe-Si system during rapid cooling. Interestingly, experimental evidence indicates that this phase forms by a first-order transition. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the q-glass nucleates from the melt as discrete particles, which grow spherically with a uniform growth rate in all directions. The diffraction pattern shows it to be an isotropic glassy phase. Yet there is a nucleation barrier, which implies an interfacial discontinuity (or internal surface) between the glass and the melt.",What is q-glass?,"{'text': array(['an isotropic non-crystalline metallic phase'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([50], dtype=int32)}","Q-glass is an isotropic non-crystalline metallic phase that forms in the Al-Fe-Si system during rapid cooling, characterized by its first-order transition and uniform spherical growth from the melt.

The greater 1 MHz bandwidth and 6 Mbit/s bit rate of the Picturephone in the 1970s also did not achieve commercial success, mostly due to its high cost, but also due to a lack of network effect —with only a few hundred Picturephones in the world, users had extremely few contacts they could actually call to, and interoperability with other videophone systems would not exist for decades.",What is one area where teleconferencing could not be used?,"{'text': array(['telemedicine'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([90], dtype=int32)}","Teleconferencing could not be used for distance education.

5728c4163acd2414000dfde1,Sahara,"The sky is usually clear above the desert and the sunshine duration is extremely high everywhere in the Sahara. Most of the desert enjoys more than 3,600 h of bright sunshine annually or over 82% of the time and a wide area in the eastern part experiences in excess of 4,000 h of bright sunshine a year or over 91% of the time, and the highest values are very close to the theoretical maximum value. A value of 4,300 h or 98% of the time would be recorded in Upper Egypt (Aswan, Luxor) and in the Nubian Desert (Wadi Halfa). The annual average direct solar irradiation is around 2,800 kWh/(m2 year) in the Great Desert. The Sahara has a huge potential for solar energy production. The constantly high position of the sun, the extremely low relative humidity, the lack of vegetation and rainfall make the Great Desert the hottest continuously large area worldwide and certainly the hottest place on Earth during summertime in some spots. The average high temperature exceeds 38 °C (100.4 °F) - 40 °C (104 °F) during the hottest month nearly everywhere in the desert except at very high mountainous areas. The highest officially recorded average high temperature was 47 °C (116.6 °F) in a remote desert town in the Algerian Desert called Bou Bernous with an elevation of 378 meters above sea level. It's the world's highest recorded average high temperature and only Death Valley, California rivals it. Other hot spots in Algeria such as Adrar, Timimoun, In Salah, Ouallene, Aoulef, Reggane with an elevation between 200 and 400 meters above sea level get slightly lower summer average highs around 46 °C (114.8 °F) during the hottest months of the year. Salah, well known in Algeria for its extreme heat, has an average high temperature of 43.8 °C (110.8 °F), 46.4 °C (115.5 °F), 45.5 (113.9 °F). Furthermore, 41.9 °C (107.4 °F) in June, July, August and September. In fact, there are even hotter spots in the Sahara, but they are located in extremely remote areas, especially in the Azalai, lying in northern Mali. The major part of the desert experiences around 3 – 5 months when the average high strictly exceeds 40 °C (104 °F). The southern central part of the desert experiences up to 6 – 7 months when the average high temperature strictly exceeds 40 °C (104 °F) which shows the constancy and the length of the really hot season in the Sahara. Some examples of this are Bilma, Niger and Faya-Largeau, Chad. The annual average daily temperature exceeds 20 °C (68 °F) everywhere and can approach 30 °C (86 °F) in the hottest regions year-round. However, most of the desert has a value in excess of 25 °C (77 °F). The sand and ground temperatures are even more extreme. During daytime, the sand temperature is extremely high as it can easily reach 80 °C (176 °F) or more. A sand temperature of 83.5 °C (182.3 °F) has been recorded in Port Sudan. Ground temperatures of 72 °C (161.6 °F) have been recorded in the Adrar of Mauritania and a value of 75 °C (167 °F) has been measured in Borkou, northern Chad. Due to lack of cloud cover and very low humidity, the desert usually features high diurnal temperature variations between days and nights. However, it's a myth that the nights are cold after extremely hot days in the Sahara. The average diurnal temperature range is typically between 13 °C (55.4 °F) and 20 °C (68 °F). The lowest values are found along the coastal regions due to high humidity and are often even lower than 10 °C (50 °F), while the highest values are found in inland desert areas where the humidity is the lowest, mainly in the southern Sahara.

The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative spice trade, an effort focused mainly on two regions; the East Indies archipelago, and an important hub in the trade network, India. There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other. Although England ultimately eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system and the three Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 when the Dutch William of Orange ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England.

Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence, distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness. The human strains of Ebola virus, for example, incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after. As a result, the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone. Also, this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye. Thus, the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging. As a result of the above features, the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area. In contrast, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system. As a result, many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease.

It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met.

The former, which is the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes animals such as snails, clams, and squids, and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as earthworms and leeches. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of trochophore larvae, but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods because they are both segmented. Now, this is generally considered convergent evolution, owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla. The Lophotrochozoa also include the Nemertea or ribbon worms, the Sipuncula, and several phyla that have a ring of ciliated tentacles around the mouth, called a lophophore. These were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates. but it now appears that the lophophorate group may be paraphyletic, with some closer to the nemerteans and some to the molluscs and annelids.

56f98cd19e9bad19000a0aa1,Zhejiang,"Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the ""Zhejiang model"", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the ""Zhejiang spirit"" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou.

56de739f4396321400ee292c,Heresy,"In other contexts the term does not necessarily have pejorative overtones and may even be complimentary when used, in areas where innovation is welcome, of ideas that are in fundamental disagreement with the status quo in any practice and branch of knowledge. Scientist/author Isaac Asimov considered heresy as an abstraction, Asimov's views are in Forward: The Role of the Heretic. mentioning religious, political, socioeconomic and scientific heresies. He divided scientific heretics into endoheretics (those from within the scientific community) and exoheretics (those from without). Characteristics were ascribed to both and examples of both kinds were offered. Asimov concluded that science orthodoxy defends itself well against endoheretics (by control of science education, grants and publication as examples), but is nearly powerless against exoheretics. He acknowledged by examples that heresy has repeatedly become orthodoxy.",Which type of heresy is the scientific community well equipped to defend itself against?,"{'text': array(['endoheretics'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([491], dtype=int32)}","The scientific community is well equipped to defend itself against endoheretics.



In the context of the philosophy of science, the term ""heresy"" refers to beliefs or theories that deviate from established scientific consensus. The distinction between endoheretics and exoheretics, as proposed by Isaac Asimov, is crucial to understanding the dynamics of scientific controversies and the evolution of scientific thought.


Endoheretics are individuals or groups within the scientific community who hold beliefs or theories that diverge from the mainstream or orthodox views. These individuals are often subject to scrutiny and criticism from their peers, and the scientific community has various mechanisms to address and potentially correct these deviations. These mechanisms include peer review processes, academic discourse, and the control of educational curricula and funding. The peer review process, in particular, serves as a gatekeeping function, ensuring that only research that meets the scientific community's standards for evidence and methodology is published. Academic discourse allows for the open exchange of ideas, where endoheretics can be challenged and their theories can be refined or disproven through rigorous debate and empirical testing.


Exoheretics, on the other hand, are those who come from outside the scientific community and whose ideas may be considered radical or unconventional. These individuals or groups may not be as easily subjected to the internal checks and balances of the scientific community. Asimov noted that while the scientific community is adept at defending itself against endoheretics, it is less effective against exoheretics. This is because exoheretics may not be as familiar with the established scientific methodologies and may not be as easily integrated into the academic and scientific discourse.


Heresy, in the scientific sense, does not necessarily carry a pejorative connotation. In fact, Asimov's perspective suggests that heresy can be a catalyst for scientific progress. When a heretical idea is rigorously tested and withstands scrutiny, it can lead to paradigm shifts and the advancement of knowledge. Asimov's own work, ""The Role of the Heretic,"" exemplifies this process, as he himself was a heretic in the sense that his ideas, such as the concept of psychohistory in his Foundation series, were initially outside the mainstream but eventually gained acceptance and influenced the direction of scientific thought.


In conclusion, the scientific community is well equipped to defend itself against endoheretics, who are part of the community and subject to its self-correcting mechanisms. The scientific method, with its emphasis on empirical evidence and peer review, serves as the primary tool for addressing and integrating or refuting heretical ideas within the community."

Kierkegaard disputes this assertion, because it eliminates the clear distinction between ontology and epistemology. Existence and thought are not identical and one cannot possibly think existence. Thought is always a form of abstraction, and thus not only is pure existence impossible to think, but all forms in existence are unthinkable; thought depends on language, which merely abstracts from experience, thus separating us from lived experience and the living essence of all beings. In addition, because we are finite beings, we cannot possibly know or understand anything that is universal or infinite such as God, so we cannot know God exists, since that which transcends time simultaneously transcends human understanding.",Why does Hegel believe we cannot know God?,"{'text': array(['we are finite beings'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([866], dtype=int32)}","Hegel believes we cannot know God because the logical structure of God' elements, which transcend time, cannot be fully comprehended by finite human minds that are inherently tied to time and abstraction.

Each segment of the abdomen is represented by a sclerotized tergum and sternum. Terga are separated from each other and from the adjacent sterna or pleura by membranes. Spiracles are located in the pleural area. Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube. Some insects bear a sclerite in the pleural area called a laterotergite. Ventral sclerites are sometimes called laterosternites. During the embryonic stage of many insects and the postembryonic stage of primitive insects, 11 abdominal segments are present. In modern insects there is a tendency toward reduction in the number of the abdominal segments, but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis. Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable.

Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the Anglo-Saxon period was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was also used in jewelry. From the 10th-century onwards, glass was employed in stained glass windows of churches and cathedrals, with famous examples at Chartres Cathedral and the Basilica of Saint Denis. By the 14th-century, architects were designing buildings with walls of stained glass such as Sainte-Chapelle, Paris, (1203–1248) and the East end of Gloucester Cathedral. Stained glass had a major revival with Gothic Revival architecture in the 19th-century. With the Renaissance, and a change in architectural style, the use of large stained glass windows became less prevalent. The use of domestic stained glass increased until most substantial houses had glass windows.

Explanation:

Liquid growth media are designed to support the growth of bacteria in suspension, which is ideal for culturing large volumes of bacteria. This is because the bacteria are evenly distributed throughout the liquid, allowing for easier division and transfer of cultures. While solid media like agar plates are excellent for isolating pure cultures, they are not as efficient for growing large volumes of bacteria.


Selective media can be used in both solid and liquid media to help identify specific organisms by providing specific nutrients or antibiotics that inhibit the growth of non-target bacteria. However, when the goal is to grow larger volumes of bacteria, liquid media are the preferred choice."
57289abd2ca10214002da4b7,History_of_India,"Like other settled, agrarian societies in history, those in the Indian subcontinent have been attacked by nomadic tribes throughout its long history. In evaluating the impact of Islam on the sub-continent, one must note that the northwestern sub-continent was a frequent target of tribes raiding from Central Asia. In that sense, the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions were not dissimilar to those of the earlier invasions during the 1st millennium. What does however, make the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions different is that unlike the preceding invaders who assimilated into the prevalent social system, the successful Muslim conquerors retained their Islamic identity and created new legal and administrative systems that challenged and usually in many cases superseded the existing systems of social conduct and ethics, even influencing the non-Muslim rivals and common masses to a large extent, though non-Muslim population was left to their own laws and customs. They also introduced new cultural codes that in some ways were very different from the existing cultural codes.

Indeed, the Qing government did far more to encourage mobility than to discourage it. Migration took several different forms, though might be divided in two varieties: permanent migration for resettlement, and relocation conceived by the party (in theory at least) as a temporary sojourn. Parties to the latter would include the empire's increasingly large and mobile manual workforce, as well as its densely overlapping internal diaspora of local-origin-based merchant groups.

These include many birds of prey such as vultures, eagles, and buzzards, but also storks. These birds migrate in the daytime. Migratory species in these groups have great difficulty crossing large bodies of water, since thermals only form over land, and these birds cannot maintain active flight for long distances. Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large raptors and storks pass through areas such as the Strait of Messina, Gibraltar, Falsterbo, and the Bosphorus at migration times. More common species, such as the European honey buzzard Pernis apivorus, can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the Central American migratory bottleneck. Batumi bottleneck in the Caucasus is one of the heaviest migratory funnels on earth. Avoiding flying over the Black Sea surface and across high mountains, hundreds of thousands of soaring birds funnel through an area around the city of Batumi, Georgia. Birds of prey such as honey buzzards which migrate using thermals lose only 10 to 20% of their weight during migration, which may explain why they forage less during migration than do smaller birds of prey with more active flight such as falcons, hawks and harriers.",What do some large broad-winged birds rely on to help them soar?,"{'text': array(['thermal columns of rising hot air'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([38], dtype=int32)}","Some large broad-winged birds rely on thermal columns of rising hot air to help them soar.

5726c05fdd62a815002e8f66,Nutrition,"A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several fatty acids (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a glycerol. They are typically found as triglycerides (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may be classified as saturated or unsaturated depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms double-bonded, so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids. Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat with trans-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) hydrogenation. There are nine kilocalories in each gram of fat.

DC avoids the electromagnetic radiation inherent with AC, and on a railway this also reduces interference with signalling and communications and mitigates hypothetical EMF risks. DC also avoids the power factor problems of AC. Of particular interest to railroading is that DC can supply constant power with a single ungrounded wire. Constant power with AC requires three-phase transmission with at least two ungrounded wires. Another important consideration is that mains-frequency 3-phase AC must be carefully planned to avoid unbalanced phase loads. Parts of the system are supplied from different phases on the assumption that the total loads of the 3 phases will even out. At the phase break points between regions supplied from different phases, long insulated supply breaks are required to avoid them being shorted by rolling stock using more than one pantograph at a time.

Locke defines the state of nature as a condition in which humans are rational and follow natural law; in which all men are born equal and with the right to life, liberty and property. However, when one citizen breaks the Law of Nature, both the transgressor and the victim enter into a state of war, from which it is virtually impossible to break free. Therefore, Locke said that individuals enter into civil society to protect their natural rights via an ""unbiased judge"" or common authority, such as courts, to appeal to. Contrastingly, Rousseau's conception relies on the supposition that ""civil man"" is corrupted, while ""natural man"" has no want he cannot fulfill himself. Natural man is only taken out of the state of nature when the inequality associated with private property is established.

For example, in the early 1980s, prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS, the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples, even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options. In part, these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus. By understanding how the disease was transmitted, resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections. The specific serological diagnostic identification, and later genotypic or molecular identification, of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins of the virus, as well as a myriad of other hypothesis. The development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with anti-retroviral drugs. Molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection. Thus, while there still is no cure for AIDS, there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals, both for the patient and for the community at large.",How was the course of AIDS followed?,"{'text': array(['monitoring the composition of patient blood samples'],

Many variations of the positive displacement pump have been developed, and many other pump designs rely on fundamentally different principles. Momentum transfer pumps, which bear some similarities to dynamic pumps used at higher pressures, can achieve much higher quality vacuums than positive displacement pumps. Entrapment pumps can capture gases in a solid or absorbed state, often with no moving parts, no seals and no vibration. None of these pumps are universal; each type has important performance limitations. They all share a difficulty in pumping low molecular weight gases, especially hydrogen, helium, and neon.",What pump has a higher quality vacuum than a positive displacement pump?,"{'text': array(['Momentum transfer pumps'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([279], dtype=int32)}","Momentum transfer pumps can achieve a higher quality vacuum than positive displacement pumps.




Momentum transfer pumps, also known as momentum exchange pumps (MEPs), are a type of vacuum pump that operates on the principle of momentum transfer rather than displacement. They are particularly effective at achités high vacuum levels and can outperform positive displacement pumps in this regard.


Momentum transfer pumps work by using a high-speed rotor and stator. The rotor, which is a spinning disk, imparts momentum to the gas molecules as it rotates. The stator, a stationary component, then catches these fast-moving molecules and directs them out of the pump. This process effectively removes gas molecules from the system, creating a vacuum.


The key advantage of momentum transfer pumps is their ability to handle gases with very low molecular weights, such as hydrogen, helium, and neon, which are challenging for positive displacement pumps. This is because the kinetic energy imparted to the gas molecules by the rotor is sufficient to overcome the residual gas pressure in the system, even at very low pressures.


However, it's important to note that while momentum transfer pumps can achieve higher vacuum levels than positive displacement pumps, they are not without limitations. They are generally more complex and can be more expensive to operate and maintain. Additionally, they may not be as effective at pumping gases with very high molecular weights or at very low pressures compared to other specialized pumps."

Descartes's work, along with Avicenna's, prefigured the 19th-century development of specificity theory. Specificity theory saw pain as ""a specific sensation, with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses"". Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory, which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality, but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light, pressure or temperature. By the mid-1890s, specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians, and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists. However, after a series of clinical observations by Henry Head and experiments by Max von Frey, the psychologists migrated to specificity almost en masse, and by century's end, most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact.",Who migrated to the theory of specificity en mass?,"{'text': array(['psychologists'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([1018], dtype=int32)}",Henry Head and Max von Frey migrated to the theory of specificity en masse.

The Israeli supreme court is both an appellate court and the high court of justice. As an appellate court, the Supreme Court considers cases on appeal (both criminal and civil) on judgments and other decisions of the District Courts. It also considers appeals on judicial and quasi-judicial decisions of various kinds, such as matters relating to the legality of Knesset elections and disciplinary rulings of the Bar Association. As the High Court of Justice (Hebrew: Beit Mishpat Gavoha Le'Zedek בית משפט גבוה לצדק; also known by its initials as Bagatz בג""ץ), the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance, primarily in matters regarding the legality of decisions of State authorities: Government decisions, those of local authorities and other bodies and persons performing public functions under the law, and direct challenges to the constitutionality of laws enacted by the Knesset. The court has broad discretionary authority to rule on matters in which it considers it necessary to grant relief in the interests of justice, and which are not within the jurisdiction of another court or tribunal. The High Court of Justice grants relief through orders such as injunction, mandamus and Habeas Corpus, as well as through declaratory judgments. The Supreme Court can also sit at a further hearing on its own judgment. In a matter on which the Supreme Court has ruled - whether as a court of appeals or as the High Court of Justice - with a panel of three or more justices, it may rule at a further hearing with a panel of a larger number of justices. A further hearing may be held if the Supreme Court makes a ruling inconsistent with a previous ruling or if the Court deems that the importance, difficulty or novelty of a ruling of the Court justifies such hearing.

Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests. Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June. The area of the United States known as the South Plains is the largest contiguous cotton-growing region in the world. While dryland (non-irrigated) cotton is successfully grown in this region, consistent yields are only produced with heavy reliance on irrigation water drawn from the Ogallala Aquifer. Since cotton is somewhat salt and drought tolerant, this makes it an attractive crop for arid and semiarid regions. As water resources get tighter around the world, economies that rely on it face difficulties and conflict, as well as potential environmental problems. For example, improper cropping and irrigation practices have led to desertification in areas of Uzbekistan, where cotton is a major export.

The occasional return to classicism—figurative work either exclusively or alongside Cubist work—experienced by many artists during this period (called Neoclassicism) has been linked to the tendency to evade the realities of the war and also to the cultural dominance of a classical or Latin image of France during and immediately following the war. Cubism after 1918 can be seen as part of a wide ideological shift towards conservatism in both French society and culture. Yet, Cubism itself remained evolutionary both within the oeuvre of individual artists, such as Gris and Metzinger, and across the work of artists as different from each other as Braque, Léger and Gleizes. Cubism as a publicly debated movement became relatively unified and open to definition.

The concept of boundaries is useful here for demonstrating how identity works. In the same way as Barth, in his approach to ethnicity, advocated the critical focus for investigation as being ""the ethnic boundary that defines the group rather than the cultural stuff that it encloses"" (1969:15), social anthropologists such as Cohen and Bray have shifted the focus of analytical study from identity to the boundaries that are used for purposes of identification. If identity is a kind of virtual site in which the dynamic processes and markers used for identification are made apparent, boundaries provide the framework on which this virtual site is built. They concentrated on how the idea of community belonging is differently constructed by individual members and how individuals within the group conceive ethnic boundaries.",Boundaries are frequently used by researchers to help define what?,"{'text': array(['identity'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([292], dtype=int32)}","Boundaries are frequently used by researchers to help define ethnic group identities.



Anthropologists have been instrumental in understanding the complexities of ethnic boundaries and their role in identity formation. The concept of boundaries is crucial in anthropology as it provides a tangible framework for examining the intangible processes of identity construction. Boundaries are not just physical demarcations but also social constructs that delineate who is included or excluded from a group.


In the context of ethnic boundaries, anthropologists like Barth, Cohen, and Bray have emphasized the importance of these boundaries in defining ethnic groups. Barth's work on ethnicity highlighted the significance of the boundary as the defining characteristic of an ethnic group, rather than the cultural practices within it. Cohen and Bray furthered this perspective by exploring how individuals within a community perceive and construct their ethnic boundaries, which can vary greatly among members.


Boundaries serve as a lens through which the dynamic processes of identity formation are made visible. They are the ""virtual site"" where the markers of identity are negotiated, contested, and redefined. By focusing on boundaries, anthropologists can better understand the fluid and often contested nature of ethnic identities.


In summary, boundaries are frequently used by researchers to help define ethnic group identities, providing a critical framework for understanding how these identities are constructed, maintained, and transformed over time."

Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue. Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture, the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army. In May 1803, the last 8000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Haïti in 1804.

It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. During the first two centuries of its existence, the Roman Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance, from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula. By the following century, it included North Africa, Spain, and what is now southern France. Two centuries after that, towards the end of the 1st century BC, it included the rest of modern France, Greece, and much of the eastern Mediterranean. By this time, internal tensions led to a series of civil wars, culminating with the assassination of Julius Caesar, which led to the transition from republic to empire. The exact date of transition can be a matter of interpretation. Historians have variously proposed Julius Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon River in 49 BC, Caesar's appointment as dictator for life in 44 BC, and the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC.

Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese.

Four variables are available to the photographer to obtain the desired effect: lighting, film speed, f-number (aperture size), and shutter speed (exposure time). The equation may be expressed as ratios, or, by taking the logarithm (base 2) of both sides, by addition, using the APEX system, in which every increment of 1 is a doubling of exposure; this increment is commonly known as a ""stop"". The effective f-number is proportional to the ratio between the lens focal length and aperture diameter, the diameter itself being proportional to the square root of the aperture area. Thus, a lens set to f/1.4 allows twice as much light to strike the focal plane as a lens set to f/2. Therefore, each f-number factor of the square root of two (approximately 1.4) is also a stop, so lenses are typically marked in that progression: f/1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, etc.",What is used to discover the right exposure parameters?,"{'text': array(['Film speed'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([0], dtype=int32)}","Film speed is used to discover the right exposure parameters.


---



In photography, the exposure triangle consists of three elements: lighting, film speed (ISO), aperture (f-number), and shutter speed. To determine the correct exposure parameters, a photographer manipulits these three variables to achieve the desired lighting effect on the film. The film speed, or ISO, is crucial as it indicates the sensitivity of the film to light. A higher ISO number means the film is more sensitive and requires less light to capture an image, but it can also lead to more grain or noise in the final photograph.


The relationship between these variables can be understood through the exposure equation:


\[ \text{Exposure} = \text{Aperture} \times \text{Shutter Speed} \]


This equation can be further expressed in terms of stops, where each stop represents a doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching the film. For example, moving from f/2 to f/1.4 doubles the light, and each f-number represents a stop.


To calculate the correct exposure, a photographer adjusts the aperture and shutter speed while considering the ISO film speed. For instance, if a photographer wants to maintain the same exposure but change the depth of field, they might adjust the aperture while keeping the ISO and shutter speed constant.


Understanding the relationship between these variables and the concept of stops is essential for photographers to control the exposure and achieve the desired artistic effect in their images."

5726c1d1dd62a815002e8f9e,Pesticide,"Since before 2000 BC, humans have utilized pesticides to protect their crops. The first known pesticide was elemental sulfur dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia. The Rig Veda, which is about 4,000 years old, mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control. By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as arsenic, mercury, and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, pyrethrum, which is derived from chrysanthemums, and rotenone, which is derived from the roots of tropical vegetables. Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant. Paul Müller discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide.

The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery, and the very next year it improved Edison's phonograph by substituting wax for tinfoil as the recording medium and incising the recording rather than indenting it, key upgrades that Edison himself later adopted. The laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his ""proudest achievement"", ""the photophone"", the ""optical telephone"" which presaged fibre optical telecommunications, while the Volta Bureau would later evolve into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (the AG Bell), a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness.",The Volta lab improved the phonograph by replacing tinfoil with what substance?,"{'text': array(['wax'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([1095], dtype=int32)}",The Volta lab improved the phonograph by replacing tinfoil with wax.

In the context of the Soviet Union's political climate during the late 1980s, the release of political prisoners on February 7, 1987, was a significant event that reflected the broader political reforms initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev, known as ""glasnost"" (openness) and ""perestroika"" (restructuring). The release of political prisoners was part of Gorbachev's efforts to reduce the repressive measures of the Soviet regime and to encourage political pluralism.


The release of political prisoners on February 7, 1987, was a direct result of the policies of glasnost and perestroika. Glasnost allowed for increased transparency in government institutions and more freedom of information, which led to a greater openness about the political prisoners and their treatment. Perestroika aimed to reform the political and economic systems, which included reducing the number of political prisoners as part of a broader move towards a more open and less authoritarian society.


The release of political prisoners was also influenced by the changing international context. The Cold War was winding down, and the Soviet Union was under pressure to conform to international human rights standards. The release of political prisoners was a step towards improving the USSR's image on the global stage and was likely influenced by the desire to reduce tensions with the West.


The release of political prisoners on February 7, 1987, was a precursor to the more significant political changes that would follow, including the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union. It was a sign of the shifting political landscape and the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union's strict control over its citizens.

The unsanctioned demonstration by Pamyat on May 6, 1987, was a display of Russian nationalist sentiment and a challenge to the policies of glasnost. Pamyat, which translates to ""Memory,"" was a group that promoted the idea of a glorious Soviet past and was critical of the current political direction of the USSR.


The authorities' decision not to break up the demonstration and to allow the marchers to reach an impromptu meeting with Boris Yeltsin, who was a prominent figure in the Communist Party and a close ally of Gorbachev, was significant. It indicated a level of tolerance for political expression that was not typical of the Soviet Union's previous approach to dissent. However, it also highlighted the complexities of Gorbachev's policies, as Yeltsin was a key figure in the reform movement, yet the demonstration was still a challenge to the current political order.


The demonstration's peaceful nature and the authorities' restrained response were indicative of the changing political climate under Gorbachev's leadership. It showed a willingness to engage with dissenting voices, albeit in a controlled manner, and was a reflection of the broader societal shifts towards openness and dialogue.

The demonstration by the 300 Crimean Tatars on July 25, 1987, was a significant event in the context of the Crimean Tatar people's history and their struggle for the right to return to their homeland. The Crimean Tatars were deported en masse from Crimea in 1944 by the Soviet government under Stalin's orders, an event known as the Crimean Tatar Deportation.


The demonstration was a peaceful protest that called for the right to return to Crimea, which had been their ancestral homeland. The fact that the demonstration was noisy and lasted for several hours indicated the depth of the Crimean Tatars' desire for justice and their willingness to assert their rights publicly.


The authorities' decision to merely look on, without breaking up the demonstration, was a departure from the typical Soviet response to dissent. This restrained reaction could be seen as a reflection of the changing political climate under Gorbachev's policies of glasnost, where public expression of political and social issues was becoming more accepted.


The demonstration was a poignant reminder of the Crimean Tatars' historical grievances and their ongoing struggle for recognition and rights. It also highlighted the complexities of the Soviet Union's internal policies and the challenges faced by minority groups in asserting their rights within the Soviet system.


---


The release of political prisoners, the unsanctioned demonstration by Pamyat, and the demonstration by the Crimean Tatars all occurred within the broader context of the Soviet Union's political and social reforms under Mikhail Gorbachev. These events were interconnected and reflected the changing dynamics of the Soviet Union's approach to dissent, political expression, and minority rights.


The release of political prisoners was part of Gorbachev's broader reform agenda, which aimed to reduce the repressive measures of the Soviet regime and encourage political pluralism. The unsanctioned demonstration by Pamyat and the demonstration by the Crimean Tatars were both expressions of political dissent that were met with varying degrees of tolerance by the authorities.


These events were significant in the context of the late 1980s as they represented a shift towards a more open and less authoritarian society. They were also indicative of the challenges faced by the Soviet Union as it navigated the complexities of implementing political reforms while maintaining control over its diverse population.


The release of political prisoners, the demonstrations, and the changing political climate all contributed to the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union and the emergence of new independent states, including the Republic of Crimea. These events were part of the larger narrative of the late Soviet Union's transformation and the end of the Cold War era."

Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child’s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells. Also, T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage.

The gene's DNA is used as a template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene.

Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from Henry Odgen Holmes, for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796. Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased from colonial plantations, processed into cotton cloth in the mills of Lancashire, and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in West Africa, India, and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong).",What American invented the cotton gin?,"{'text': array(['Eli Whitney'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([117], dtype=int32)}","The American inventor who invented the cotton gin was Eli Whitney.

573123ff05b4da19006bcdef,Bird,"Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen.

56d5da871c85041400946e39,Dog,"Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli. As the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from 9,000–30,000 years BCE, the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and they are uniquely attuned to our behaviors. Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the otherwise humble domestic dog. These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes. Rather, these skills parallel some of the social-cognitive skills of human children.",Dogs are  very well attuned to what other species' behaviors?,"{'text': array(['humans.'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([320], dtype=int32)}","Dogs are very well attuned to human behaviors.


Explanation: The context provided discusses how dogs have evolved to understand and communicate with humans due to their long history of domestication. This attunement is highlighted as a unique ability among dogs, distinguishing them from other species and even from other highly intelligent mammals.


---



Dog behavior encompasses a wide range of actions and inactions that dogs exhibit in response to various stimuli. This behavior is influenced by both their genetic makeup and the environment, particularly their interactions with humans. The domestic dog's ability to understand and communicate with humans is a result of their long-standing relationship with humans, which dates back to at least 9,000 years BCE. This relationship has led to the development of social-cognitive skills in dogs that are comparable to those of human children, which are not found in their closest canine relatives or other intelligent mammals like great apes.


Question: ""In terms of social-cognitive skills, how do dogs compare to human children and other intelligent mammals?""


Answer: Dogs have social-cognitive skills that are similar to those of human children, which are not found in their closest canine relatives or other intelligent mammals such as great apes.


Explanation: The context emphasizes that dogs have developed a set of social-cognitive abilities that are particularly similar to those of human children. This is a distinctive feature of dogs, as these skills are not shared with their closest relatives or other intelligent mammals, which indicates a unique evolutionary path influenced by their close association with humans."

Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen ""nation"" as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry. This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under his personal control, it also greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily.

Television reports showed the flame flanked by motorcycles and uniformed police officers. Two torchbearers carried the flame running slowly behind a truck and surrounded by Olympic security guards. During the torch relay, two torchbearers, Andrew Michael who uses a wheelchair and is the Vice President for Sustainable Development for the Bay Area Council and Director of Partnerships For Change, and an environmental advocate, Majora Carter, managed to display Tibetan flags in protest, resulting in their ejection from the relay.
